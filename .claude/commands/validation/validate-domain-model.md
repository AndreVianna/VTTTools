# Validate Domain Model Command

Validates domain model specifications against DDD principles, completeness standards, and implementation readiness. Provides scoring, prioritized improvements, and auto-fix capability with standardized 3-section output.

**Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)

## Quick Reference
- **Template**: Documents/Templates/DOMAIN_MODEL_TEMPLATE.md
- **Tech Stack**: Documents/Guides/VTTTOOLS_STACK.md
- **Architecture**: DDD Contracts + Service Implementation pattern

## Process

### Scope Determination

- **STEP 0A**: Parse {area_name} parameter:
  <case {area_name}>
  <is empty or "all">
    - Set {validation_scope} = "all_areas"
    - Use Glob: "Documents/Areas/*/DOMAIN_MODEL.md"
  <otherwise>
    - Set {validation_scope} = "single_area"
    - Use Glob: "Documents/Areas/{area_name}/DOMAIN_MODEL.md"
    - <if (not found)>
      - Error with available areas, abort
    </if>
  </case>

- **STEP 0B**: Initialize iteration tracking

### Quality Scoring

<foreach {domain_model_file} in {domain_model_files}>

- **STEP 1A**: Use Task tool with code-reviewer agent:
  ```markdown
  ROLE: Domain Model Quality Reviewer

  TASK: Score domain model against DDD principles and DOMAIN_MODEL_TEMPLATE checklist

  DOMAIN MODEL FILE: {file_path}

  SCORING RUBRIC (100 points):

  **Entities (30 points)**:
  - 10pts: All entities have complete attribute lists with types and constraints
  - 10pts: All entities have invariants clearly defined (enforced in services is acceptable)
  - 5pts: All entity operations documented (even if implemented in services)
  - 5pts: Aggregate roots clearly identified

  **Value Objects (20 points)**:
  - 10pts: All value objects have properties and validation rules
  - 5pts: Immutability and value equality documented
  - 5pts: Factory methods for creation defined (or direct enum usage)

  **Aggregates (25 points)**:
  - 10pts: Aggregate boundaries clearly defined (what's in, what's out)
  - 10pts: Aggregate invariants across entities specified
  - 5pts: Lifecycle management rules documented

  **Application Services (15 points)**:
  - 10pts: Service interface contracts defined (I{Entity}Service in domain project)
  - 5pts: Operations documented with pre/post-conditions and invariants to be enforced

  **Ubiquitous Language (10 points)**:
  - 10pts: Complete domain terminology with definitions (10+ terms minimum)

  ARCHITECTURE PATTERN: DDD Contracts + Service Implementation
  - Domain entities are **data contracts** (anemic entities are ACCEPTABLE and expected)
  - Business logic implemented in **application services** (not in entities)
  - Service interfaces must be in domain project (contracts)

  CRITICAL CHECKS:
  - No infrastructure dependencies in domain contracts
  - Service interfaces defined in domain project
  - Aggregates have clear boundaries
  - Value objects are immutable
  - 10+ ubiquitous language terms defined
  - Invariants documented (enforcement in services is acceptable)

  Identify issues by priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

  OUTPUT: Scores and prioritized improvements.
  ```

- **STEP 1B**: Parse scores and store

</foreach>

### Display Results

#### Section 1: Grade Table
```
DOMAIN MODEL VALIDATION
<if (scope is all)>
Areas Validated: {count}
Average Score: {avg}/100
</if>
<if (scope is single)>
Area: {area_name}
</if>
Iteration: {iteration}
Overall: {score}/100 ({PASS/FAIL})

Dimension                    | Score  | Target | Status
-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------
Entities                     | XX/30  | 24/30  | PASS/WARN
Value Objects                | XX/20  | 16/20  | PASS/WARN
Aggregates                   | XX/25  | 20/25  | PASS/WARN
Domain Services              | XX/15  | 12/15  | PASS/WARN
Ubiquitous Language          | XX/10  |  8/10  | PASS/WARN
-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------
TOTAL                        | XX/100 | 80/100 | PASS/WARN
```

#### Section 2: Proposed Improvements
```
PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS

🔴 CRITICAL ({count})
1. [Asset Entity] Missing invariants
   Current: No invariants documented
   Required: Define business rules (e.g., Name not empty, Type valid)
   Impact: +10 pts | Effort: Low

🟡 HIGH ({count})
{improvements}

🟢 MEDIUM ({count})
{improvements}

🔵 LOW ({count})
{improvements}
```

#### Section 3: Apply Changes

### Auto-Fix Implementation

- **STEP 3A**: Execute selected improvements
- **STEP 3B**: Store improvements in memory
- **STEP 3C**: Recursively re-run validation
- **STEP 3D**: Display iteration comparison

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
- Validates against DOMAIN_MODEL_TEMPLATE embedded checklist
- Ensures DDD principles (domain purity, rich entities, clear aggregates)
- Supports scope: specific area or all areas
- Iterative improvement with auto-fix
- Console-only output with standardized 3-section format
- Critical for ensuring domain models are implementation-ready
