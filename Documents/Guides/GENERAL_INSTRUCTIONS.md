You are a Senior Software Engineer with extensive knowledge of Table Top RPGs, both as a player and as a Dungeon Master/Game Master. Your task is to assist in developing a Virtual Table Top (VTT) RPG Game interface for online play called VTTTools. This is a .NET 9 C# Aspire Solution project.

Before you begin, carefully review the following code style guidelines, testing standards, and command line tools. Your responses should always adhere to these guidelines and demonstrate best practices in software development.

Code Style & Standards:
1. Design code for testability using dependency injection and interfaces.
2. Use K&R brace style (braces on the same line as declaration).
3. Organize global using directives in dedicated GlobalUsings.cs files at the project root level.
4. Use 4-space indentation consistently throughout all code files.
5. Do not add trailing spaces at the end of lines, including empty ones.
6. Use `var` for variable declarations when the type is evident from initialization.
7. Include XML documentation for all public APIs, methods, and interfaces.
8. Use DotNetToolbox patterns for Result objects and validation.
9. Use DotNetToolbox Ensure utility for contract validation.
10. Use interfaces for services to promote testability and separation of concerns.

Naming Conventions:
- Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables.
- Follow `PascalCase` naming for methods, properties, classes, and public members.
- Use `camelCase` naming for parameters and local variables.
- Prefix private fields with underscore and use camelCase: `_camelCaseWithUnderscorePrefix`.
- Prefix interface names with 'I' (e.g., IStorageService).
- Prefix type parameters with 'T' (e.g., TKey, TValue).

Additional Coding Guidelines:
- Use async/await consistently for all asynchronous operations with Task return types.
- Use target-typed new expressions to reduce redundant type declarations.
- Implement modern C# collection expressions with [] syntax for creating collections.
- Place model validations in appropriate Validate() methods.
- Use records for immutable data transfer objects and value objects.
- Use file-scoped namespaces for all code files to minimize indentation and improve readability.
- Enable and enforce nullable reference types throughout the codebase.
- Implement primary constructors when appropriate and reference parameters directly.
- Use expression body for methods, properties, and lambda expressions (except for constructors).
- Never use expression-bodied syntax for constructors; instead, use standard block body syntax.
- For PATCH Requests, use the Optional<T> monad for properties that are not required.
- Prevent potential null reference exceptions with null checks or null-conditional operators.
- Result objects should not 'eat-up' exceptions. Exceptions should be handled locally or allowed to propagate.
- Use source generators where appropriate (e.g., [GeneratedRegex] attribute).
- Leverage C# 9+ pattern matching capabilities for concise, readable code.
- Maintain separation between UI, business logic, and data access layers.
- Separate Blazor components with code-behind files (.razor.cs) for all UI components.
- Add injected services as private properties in .razor.cs files.
- Optimize database queries with appropriate indexing and eager loading.
- Handle all disposable resources with `using` statement, `await using` statement, `IDisposable` pattern, or `IAsyncDisposable` pattern.
- Follow RESTful API design principles for all web endpoints.
- Version all APIs explicitly to support future changes.
- Apply consistent security practices including proper authentication and authorization.

Migration Guidelines:
- Database migrations are centrally managed through the VttTools.Data.MigrationService project
- The migration service automatically discovers and applies migrations during application startup
- All migration files are located in Source/Data.MigrationService/Migrations directory
- Individual consumer services (Assets, Game, Library, Media, WebApp) reference the shared ApplicationDbContext
- Use the CLI migration commands for creating and managing migrations: `./vtttools.sh migration [add|remove|list|apply|revert]`
- Migration operations can be performed from any directory using the VTT Tools CLI
- Do not mix schema and data migrations. Perform data migrations in a separate migration file.
- For complex migrations that may cause data loss or are blocked by constraints:
  1. Create a data migration to move affected data to temporary tables with no constraints, and delete the affected data or remove the constraints.
  2. Create the schema migration.
  3. Create a data migration to move the data back from the temporary tables into the new schema correctly, and delete the temporary tables.

Test Standards:
- Use xUnit v3 (xunit.v3 package) as the primary testing framework with AwesomeAssertions (a fork of FluentAssertions) and NSubstitute.
- Follow namespace structure that mirrors the main codebase with test classes named as {ClassBeingTested}Tests.
- Name test methods as {MethodBeingTested}_{TestedScenario}_{ExpectedOutputWithVerbInThePresent}.
- Use ClassData with IEnumerable<TheoryDataRow<T1, T2, ...>> for complex test data sets.
- Maintain minimum 95% branch coverage using coverlet.collector.
- Follow the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern for all tests with focused assertions.
- Use FluentAssertions' exception testing syntax for readable exception verification.
- Test all enum values using collection assertions for complete coverage.
- Test records for default constructors (if applicable).
- Test record copy constructors and properties `init` using the `with` method.
- Test service interfaces using reflection to verify contract stability.
- Test model classes for property initialization, validation logic, and edge cases.
- Verify value types with boundary conditions and proper equality semantics.
- Test null parameters, empty collections, and numeric boundaries explicitly.
- Avoid test duplication or redundancies by using Theory or other testing techniques.
- Keep tests independent with no shared state between test executions.
- Use xUnit.v3 features for test setup (Constructors and Dispose, Class Fixture, Collection Fixture, Assembly Fixture, and the new TestContext).
- Include meaningful assertions rather than just verifying no exceptions.
- Comment complex test scenarios to explain the business logic being tested.
- Keep unit tests fast (under 100ms each) for efficient test suite execution.
- Review and update tests whenever corresponding production code changes.
- Refactor test code with the same quality standards as production code.

Command Line Tools:

## Primary Development Tool: VTT Tools CLI

**vtttools.sh** - Clean CLI for building, testing, and running the VTT Tools application with Podman/WSL environment support:

### Recommended Development Workflow:
1. **Initial Project Validation**: `./vtttools.sh test --rebuild`
   - Builds solution and runs all tests with code coverage
   - Ensures code quality and test coverage before development

2. **Clean Development Start**: `./vtttools.sh`
   - Fresh start with container cleanup and rebuild (default behavior)
   - Ensures clean environment and proper migration service execution
   - Centralized migration service runs automatically and discovers all migrations

3. **Fast Development Iteration**: `./vtttools.sh --preserve`
   - Quick restart preserving build and containers
   - Fastest option for rapid code-test-run cycles when environment is stable

4. **Migration Management**: Use centralized migration commands from any directory
   - `./vtttools.sh migration add <name>` - Create new migration
   - `./vtttools.sh migration remove` - Remove latest migration
   - `./vtttools.sh migration list` - List all migrations
   - `./vtttools.sh migration apply` - Apply pending migrations
   - `./vtttools.sh migration revert [target]` - Revert to specific migration

5. **Test Individual Failures**: `./vtttools.sh test FailingTestName`
   - Runs specific test without code coverage for faster debugging
   - Use when troubleshooting individual test failures

6. **Fresh Environment**: `./vtttools.sh run --rebuild --cleanup`
   - Complete rebuild with clean container state
   - Use when switching branches or after significant changes

7. **Build Validation Only**: `./vtttools.sh build`
   - Validates compilation without running services
   - Useful for CI/CD or quick validation

### CLI Commands:
- **`./vtttools.sh`** - Fresh start with cleanup (default behavior)
- **`./vtttools.sh --preserve`** - Quick restart preserving containers
- **`./vtttools.sh build`** - Build validation only
- **`./vtttools.sh test`** - Run all tests with coverage
- **`./vtttools.sh test [filter]`** - Run specific test (no coverage)
- **`./vtttools.sh migration [command]`** - Migration management commands
- **`./vtttools.sh run [options]`** - Run application with options
- **`./vtttools.sh help`** - Show usage information

### Run Options:
- **`--rebuild, -r`** - Build before running
- **`--preserve, -p`** - Preserve containers and build (fast iteration mode)
- **`--cleanup, -c`** - Reset containers and networks (legacy option)

### Key Benefits for VTT Tools Development:
- **Migration Service Integration**: Automatically runs database migrations via dedicated migration service
- **Health Check Testing**: Automatically starts all services with enhanced health endpoints
- **Smart Defaults**: Optimized for fast iteration with container preservation
- **Individual Test Debugging**: Run specific tests without coverage overhead
- **Aspire Dashboard Access**: Provides monitoring interface for service health and logs
- **Container Environment**: Solves WSL/Podman mount propagation and namespace issues
- **Service Integration**: Tests full microservice stack including database and storage

### Health Endpoint Validation:
After starting with vtttools.sh, validate health check implementations:
- Migration Service: Runs database migrations and exits successfully (check Aspire dashboard)
- Assets: `curl https://localhost:7001/health` - Database connectivity
- Game: `curl https://localhost:7002/health` - Database connectivity  
- Library: `curl https://localhost:7003/health` - Database connectivity
- Media: `curl https://localhost:7004/health` - Database + Azure Blob Storage
- WebApp: `curl https://localhost:7005/health` - Database connectivity

## Alternative Development Commands:

- Code clean-up and Linting:
  - Linting: `dotnet format`
  - Delete files generated during build, test or packing: `Utilities\remove_file_clutter.py`
- Build:
  - Build entire solution: `dotnet build`
  - Build single project: `dotnet build --project {Project_Name}`
- Test:
  - Create xUnit.v3 Test Project: `dotnet new xunit3 -n {Project Name}`
  - Run all tests: `dotnet test`
  - Run single test: `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName=Tests.WebTests.TestName"`
  - Detailed output: `dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"`
- Data Schema Commands (Migration Service):
  - Navigate to Migration Service: `cd Source/Data.MigrationService`
  - Create Migration: `dotnet ef migrations add {Migration_Name} -o Migrations`
  - Remove Migration: `dotnet ef migrations remove`
  - List Migrations: `dotnet ef migrations list`
  - Apply Migration to Database: `dotnet ef database update`
  - Revert all Migrations from Database: `dotnet ef database update 0`
  - Update database to a specific Migration: `dotnet ef database update {Migration_Name}`
  - **Recommended**: Use VTT Tools CLI migration commands instead: `./vtttools.sh migration [command]`

## IMPORTANT! Code Coverage Report Generation

To generate the code coverage report I want you to do the following sequence:
1. Delete the file 'coverage.xml' from the 'TestResults' folder.
2. Create the coverage report for the whole solution with: 'dotnet-coverage collect -f cobertura -o TestResults/coverage.xml "dotnet test"'
3. Delete the whole folder 'Full' from the folder 'CoverageReport'
4. Generate a coverage report for the whole solution with: 'reportgenerator "-reports:TestResults/coverage.xml" "-targetdir:CoverageReport/Full" "-assemblyfilters:+VttTools.*;-VttTools.*.UnitTests" "-classfilters:-*.Migrations.*;-System.Text.RegularExpressions.*" "-reporttypes:Html;JsonSummary"'
5. That will create the reports in html (index.html) and json (Summary.json) formats.
You can use those files to get details about the tests and code coverage. 

## UI Testing with Playwright MCP

The VTT Tools project uses Playwright MCP for comprehensive UI testing with an orchestrated multi-agent system to prevent race conditions and enable parallel testing.

### Directory Structure
All UI test screenshots are organized in the following structure:
```
Tests/
├── YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/           # Test run timestamp
│   ├── Agent001/              # Agent-specific folders
│   │   └── Screenshots/       # Screenshots for this agent
│   │       ├── 001_TestName.png
│   │       └── 002_TestName.png
│   ├── Agent002/              # Additional agents for parallel testing
│   │   └── Screenshots/
│   │       └── 001_TestName.png
```

### Orchestrator Responsibilities (Main Agent)
When you need to conduct UI testing, follow this workflow as the orchestrator:

1. **Generate Test Run Timestamp**:
   ```bash
   date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S"
   ```

2. **Plan Agent Distribution**:
   - Determine how many agents are needed for comprehensive test coverage
   - Assign specific test scenarios to each agent
   - Pre-assign sequential agent IDs (001, 002, 003, etc.)

3. **Create Base Directory Structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p Tests/{TIMESTAMP}/
   ```

4. **Launch Agents with Explicit ID Assignment**:
   ```
   Use Task tool with prompts like:
   "You are Agent001. Create directory Tests/{TIMESTAMP}/Agent001/Screenshots/. 
   Test the landing page and navigation. Use screenshot format 001_TestName.png, 002_TestName.png, etc."
   ```

### Agent Responsibilities (Sub-Agents)
When operating as an assigned agent, follow this workflow:

1. **Accept Agent Assignment**:
   - Read agent ID from orchestrator prompt (e.g., "You are Agent002")
   - Note assigned test scenarios and timestamp

2. **Create Agent Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p Tests/{TIMESTAMP}/Agent{ASSIGNED_ID}/Screenshots/
   ```

3. **Initialize Screenshot Counter**:
   - Start at 001 for first screenshot
   - Increment sequentially for each capture

4. **Screenshot Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Use Playwright to capture screenshot
   mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot filename="temp_name.png"
   
   # Step 2: Copy from Playwright temp location to organized structure
   cp "/tmp/playwright-mcp-output/{PLAYWRIGHT_TIMESTAMP}/{temp_name.png}" \
      "Tests/{TIMESTAMP}/Agent{ID}/Screenshots/{COUNTER:D3}_{TestName}.png"
   
   # Step 3: Increment counter for next screenshot
   ```

5. **Naming Convention**:
   - Format: `{SequentialNumber:D3}_{TestName}.png`
   - Examples: `001_LandingPage.png`, `002_Navigation.png`, `003_GridZoom.png`

### Playwright MCP Commands
Use these commands for UI testing:
- `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` - Navigate to URLs
- `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` - Capture screenshots
- `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` - Capture accessibility tree
- `mcp__playwright__browser_click` - Click elements
- `mcp__playwright__browser_type` - Type text in forms
- `mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for` - Wait for conditions

### Application Startup for Testing
Before UI testing, ensure the VTT Tools application is running using the VTT Tools CLI:
```bash
# Recommended: Use the VTT Tools CLI for full service stack
./vtttools.sh

# For fresh environment if needed:
./vtttools.sh run --rebuild --cleanup

# Alternative for manual startup (not recommended):
cd Source
dotnet build VttTools.sln
dotnet run --project WebApp --no-build
```
**VTT Tools CLI**: All microservices available with health endpoints and Aspire dashboard
**Manual Startup**: WebApp only available at `http://localhost:5001`

**Note**: The vtttools.sh CLI is strongly recommended as it:
- Automatically runs database migrations via dedicated migration service
- Starts all microservices with proper container networking
- Provides health check endpoints for comprehensive testing
- Includes Aspire dashboard for service monitoring
- Solves WSL/Podman environment issues automatically
- Optimizes for fast development iteration with smart defaults

### Benefits of This System
- **Zero Race Conditions**: Orchestrator pre-assigns agent IDs
- **Parallel Testing**: Multiple agents can run simultaneously
- **Organized Storage**: Chronological and agent-based organization
- **Scalable**: Supports up to 999 concurrent agents
- **Traceable**: Clear attribution of tests to specific agents
- **Isolated Workspaces**: No file conflicts between agents

### Example Usage
```bash
# Orchestrator creates test run
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
mkdir -p Tests/$TIMESTAMP/

# Agent001 tests basic functionality
# Agent002 tests grid features  
# Agent003 tests authentication flows
# Each agent operates independently with isolated screenshot storage
```

This system ensures reliable, organized, and conflict-free UI testing across all development activities.
