# Use Case UC002: Dashboard Authenticated User

## Actor
User (authenticated user)

## Goal
Access a comprehensive dashboard/home page that provides efficient navigation to all application features and displays recent activity for streamlined workflow management

## Preconditions
- User is successfully authenticated with valid session
- User has appropriate permissions for application features
- Backend services are available and responding

## Main Flow
1. User completes successful authentication (login)
2. System redirects to dashboard/home page
3. System loads and renders navigation menu based on user permissions
4. System fetches and displays user's recent activity (last 20 items)
5. System displays profile summary with current user information
6. User reviews recent activity and available features
7. User selects desired feature or continues previous work from activity feed

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Insufficient Permissions:**
1. System determines user has limited permissions
2. System displays only authorized features in navigation
3. System shows appropriate messaging for restricted features

**A2 - Recent Activity Loading Failure:**
1. System fails to fetch recent activity data
2. System displays error message in activity section
3. System provides refresh option to retry activity loading
4. Navigation and other dashboard features remain functional

**A3 - Large Activity Dataset:**
1. System detects more than 50 recent activities
2. System implements pagination or virtual scrolling for performance
3. System loads activities in batches to maintain responsiveness

## Postconditions
- User has access to personalized dashboard with navigation hub
- User can efficiently navigate to all authorized application features
- User has visibility into recent work and can continue previous activities
- User profile information is accessible and editable

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard renders user content within 1.5 seconds of successful authentication
- [ ] Navigation displays all features (Adventures, Assets, Sessions, Scene Builder) with current user permissions
- [ ] Recent activity shows last 20 items with timestamps and links to continue work
- [ ] Dashboard handles up to 50 recent activities without performance degradation
- [ ] Profile summary displays current user info with edit access and loading states

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Implement dashboard as main authenticated route with React Router
- Use React Context or Redux for authentication state management
- Implement lazy loading for dashboard components to improve initial load time
- Use React Query or RTK Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Implement permission-based conditional rendering for navigation items
- Use virtualization for activity feed if dealing with large datasets
- Implement proper loading states for all dashboard sections
- Use memoization for expensive dashboard calculations
- Integrate with SignalR for real-time activity updates
- Implement proper error boundaries for dashboard sections
- Use Bootstrap 5 layout components for responsive dashboard design
