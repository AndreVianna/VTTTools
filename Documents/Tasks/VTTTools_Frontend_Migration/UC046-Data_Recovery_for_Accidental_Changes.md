# UC046 - Data Recovery for Accidental Changes

## Use Case Information
- **Use Case ID**: UC046
- **Use Case Name**: Data Recovery for Accidental Changes
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to recover accidental changes to my data so that I don't permanently lose important work due to user error
- **Actor(s)**: All authenticated users (GMs and Players)
- **System**: VTTTools React Frontend Application - Data Protection & Recovery System

## Preconditions
- User is logged into the VTTTools application
- User has been creating or modifying content (scenes, adventures, assets, profiles)
- Data recovery system is active and monitoring user changes
- Recovery mechanisms (auto-save, change tracking) are operational

## Postconditions
- User data has been recovered from accidental loss or modification
- User work session continues with minimal interruption
- Data integrity is maintained throughout recovery process
- User confidence in data safety is preserved
- Recovery event is logged for system improvement

## Main Flow
1. **User experiences accidental change** (navigation, browser refresh, session timeout, misclick)
2. **System detects potential data loss scenario** through monitoring and change tracking
3. **System identifies recoverable data** from auto-save, change history, or session storage
4. **System presents recovery options** with clear descriptions of available data states
5. **User selects recovery option** (restore from auto-save, revert changes, continue with current state)
6. **System executes data recovery** by restoring selected data state
7. **System validates recovered data** for integrity and completeness
8. **System resumes normal operation** with recovered data active
9. **System provides confirmation** of successful recovery to user

## Alternative Flows
### A1: Browser Crash/Unexpected Close Recovery
1a. User's browser crashes or closes unexpectedly during work session
2a. System detects session interruption on next application load
3a. System identifies auto-saved data and change history from interrupted session
4a. System presents recovery dialog on application restart
5a. User chooses to recover interrupted session or start fresh
6a. If recovery selected, system restores last known state with unsaved changes

### A2: Accidental Navigation Recovery
1a. User accidentally navigates away from form with unsaved changes
2a. System prevents navigation and displays "Unsaved Changes" dialog
3a. System offers options: Save and Continue, Discard Changes, Cancel Navigation
4a. If user selects Cancel, navigation is prevented and work continues
5a. If user selects Save, changes are saved before navigation
6a. If user selects Discard, confirmation prompt appears before discarding

### A3: Session Timeout Recovery
1a. User's session expires due to inactivity during content creation
2a. System detects expired session during next user interaction
3a. System preserves unsaved changes in local storage during timeout
4a. After re-authentication, system offers to restore pre-timeout work
5a. User can recover work or start fresh after successful login

### A4: Mass Data Recovery
1a. User accidentally performs bulk operation (bulk delete, mass edit)
2a. System detects significant data changes and prompts for confirmation
3a. After confirmation, system creates recovery checkpoint
4a. If user realizes mistake, system offers rollback to pre-operation state
5a. System can restore individual items or entire operation impact

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Recovery System Architecture
```typescript
interface RecoveryState {
  sessionId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  dataType: RecoveryDataType;
  originalData: any;
  changedData: any;
  changeHistory: DataChange[];
  recoveryMethods: RecoveryMethod[];
}

enum RecoveryDataType {
  SceneBuilder = 'scene-builder',
  Adventure = 'adventure',
  Asset = 'asset',
  Profile = 'profile',
  GameSession = 'game-session'
}

enum RecoveryMethod {
  AutoSave = 'auto-save',
  ChangeHistory = 'change-history',
  SessionStorage = 'session-storage',
  LocalStorage = 'local-storage',
  ServerDraft = 'server-draft'
}

interface RecoveryDialog {
  trigger: RecoveryTrigger;
  availableStates: RecoveryState[];
  recommendedAction: RecoveryAction;
  userChoice?: RecoveryAction;
}
```

### Auto-Save Integration
- **Periodic Auto-Save**: Every 30 seconds for active content editing
- **Change-Triggered Save**: Major operations trigger immediate auto-save
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works offline with sync when connection restored
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles simultaneous edits and version conflicts

### Local Storage Strategy
- **Session Persistence**: Critical data stored in sessionStorage for crash recovery
- **Cross-Tab Coordination**: Multiple tabs coordinate recovery state
- **Storage Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old recovery data
- **Size Management**: Efficient storage to stay within browser limits

## Acceptance Criteria

### Accidental Change Protection
- [ ] Change tracking and recovery prevents permanent loss from accidental data modifications
- [ ] Data recovery prompts appear when users attempt navigation with unsaved changes
- [ ] Recovery system detects and protects against common accident patterns (bulk delete, navigation away)
- [ ] Users can recover work after browser crashes, session timeouts, or unexpected application closure
- [ ] Recovery options are presented clearly with recommendations for best data protection

### Auto-Save Integration
- [ ] Auto-save functionality coordinates with undo/redo system to preserve recovery points every 30 seconds
- [ ] Auto-save works seamlessly across all content types (scenes, adventures, assets, profiles)
- [ ] Auto-save operates without interrupting user workflow or causing UI lag
- [ ] Auto-saved data synchronizes with server when connection is available
- [ ] Conflict resolution handles simultaneous edits from multiple sessions gracefully

### Recovery Dialog Experience
- [ ] Recovery dialogs present clear options with descriptions of what will be recovered
- [ ] Recovery recommendations guide users toward best data protection choice
- [ ] Recovery operations complete within 2 seconds for normal data volumes
- [ ] Users can preview recovery options before committing to restore operations
- [ ] Recovery confirmations provide clear feedback on what was recovered and any data implications

- [ ] Recovery data persists reliably across browser sessions and system restarts
- [ ] Recovery operations maintain data integrity and don't introduce corruption
- [ ] System handles recovery failures gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Content Type Coverage
