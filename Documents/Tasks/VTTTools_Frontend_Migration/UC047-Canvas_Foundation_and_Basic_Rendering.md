# UC047 - Canvas Foundation and Basic Rendering

## Use Case Information
- **Use Case ID**: UC047
- **Use Case Name**: Canvas Foundation and Basic Rendering
- **User Story**: As a GM, I want a multi-layer Konva.js canvas foundation so that I can have high-performance rendering for complex battle maps
- **Actor(s)**: Game Master (GM)
- **System**: VTTTools React Frontend Application - Scene Builder Canvas Engine

## Preconditions
- GM is logged into the VTTTools application
- Scene Builder module is loaded and initialized
- Konva.js library is available and compatible with React
- Browser supports WebGL acceleration for optimal performance
- Scene data structure is available for rendering

## Postconditions
- Multi-layer canvas foundation is established and responsive
- Canvas rendering system is optimized for 60fps performance
- Layer architecture supports all Scene Builder features
- Canvas event handling is ready for user interactions
- Performance monitoring provides real-time feedback
- Canvas scales properly across different screen sizes

## Main Flow
1. **GM navigates to Scene Builder** from dashboard or adventure management
2. **System initializes Konva.js Stage** with optimal dimensions and configuration
3. **System creates layer hierarchy** (Background → Grid → Assets → UI Overlay)
4. **System establishes event handling** for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions
5. **System enables performance monitoring** with frame rate tracking
6. **Canvas renders initial state** with empty layers and default configuration
7. **System confirms canvas responsiveness** and reports ready state
8. **GM can begin scene building** with fully functional canvas foundation

## Alternative Flows
### A1: WebGL Acceleration Unavailable
2a. System detects WebGL is not supported or disabled
2b. System falls back to 2D canvas rendering with performance warnings
2c. System adjusts performance expectations and limits for 2D mode
2d. Canvas initializes with reduced complexity limits

### A2: Canvas Resize Required
6a. System detects viewport size change (window resize, panel changes)
6b. System recalculates optimal canvas dimensions
6c. System updates Stage size maintaining aspect ratio and content positioning
6d. All layers adjust to new canvas dimensions without content loss

### A3: Performance Degradation Detected
5a. System monitors frame rate drops below 50fps threshold
5b. System identifies performance bottlenecks (layer count, object count, effects)
5c. System applies automatic optimizations (object pooling, render culling)
5d. System notifies user if manual intervention needed

### A4: Layer Management Required
3a. System needs to add or remove specialized layers dynamically
3b. System maintains proper layer ordering and z-index management
3c. All existing content maintains proper layer assignment
3d. New layers integrate seamlessly with existing event handling

## Technical Implementation Notes

### React + Konva.js Integration Architecture
```typescript
interface SceneCanvasProps {
  width: number;
  height: number;
  sceneData: SceneData;
  onCanvasReady: (stage: Konva.Stage) => void;
  onPerformanceUpdate: (metrics: PerformanceMetrics) => void;
}

interface LayerHierarchy {
  backgroundLayer: Konva.Layer;
  gridLayer: Konva.Layer;
  assetsLayer: Konva.Layer;
  uiOverlayLayer: Konva.Layer;
}

const SceneCanvas: React.FC<SceneCanvasProps> = ({
  width, height, sceneData, onCanvasReady, onPerformanceUpdate
}) => {
  const stageRef = useRef<Konva.Stage>(null);
  const layersRef = useRef<LayerHierarchy>(null);
  
  return (
    <Stage ref={stageRef} width={width} height={height}>
      <Layer ref={el => layersRef.current.backgroundLayer = el} />
      <Layer ref={el => layersRef.current.gridLayer = el} />
      <Layer ref={el => layersRef.current.assetsLayer = el} />
      <Layer ref={el => layersRef.current.uiOverlayLayer = el} />
    </Stage>
  );
};
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **WebGL Acceleration**: Utilize WebGL rendering when available with 2D canvas fallback
- **Layer Caching**: Enable layer caching for static content (background, grid)
- **Selective Rendering**: Only redraw layers that have changed content
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse Konva objects to minimize garbage collection
- **Frame Rate Monitoring**: Real-time FPS tracking with automatic optimization

### Event Handling Foundation
- **Multi-Touch Support**: Handle both mouse and touch interactions
- **Event Delegation**: Efficient event handling through layer-based delegation
- **Gesture Recognition**: Foundation for zoom, pan, and rotation gestures
- **Keyboard Integration**: Canvas focus management for keyboard shortcuts

### Responsive Canvas Strategy
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Canvas adapts to container size changes
- **Aspect Ratio Management**: Maintain scene proportions across different screen sizes
- **DPI Scaling**: Handle high-DPI displays with proper scaling
- **Container Integration**: Seamless integration with React layout components
