# UC027: Manage Ongoing Game Sessions

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC027  
**Use Case Name**: Manage Ongoing Game Sessions  
**User Story**: As a user, I want to manage ongoing game sessions so that I can control the flow of gameplay  
**Primary Actor**: Game Master (GM) or Session Host  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Game Session Management  
**Level**: User Task  

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated as session host or GM
- A game session has been scheduled and is currently active or ready to start
- Players have joined or been invited to the session

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Session Access**: GM accesses active session management dashboard
2. **Session Start**: GM officially starts the game session for all participants
3. **Player Management**: GM monitors player connections and manages participant access
4. **Session Controls**: GM uses session control tools (pause, resume, break management)
5. **Real-time Coordination**: GM coordinates with players through integrated communication tools
6. **Scene Management**: GM manages scene transitions and content during gameplay
7. **Session Monitoring**: GM tracks session duration and participant engagement
8. **Session End**: GM officially ends the session and handles post-session cleanup

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Session Pre-start Setup
- 2a1. GM reviews session preparation checklist before starting
- 2a2. GM loads prepared scenes and assets for the session
- 2a3. GM configures session-specific settings and permissions
- 2a4. GM waits for minimum required players before starting
- 2a5. Continue from step 3 once ready

### 3a. Player Connection Issues
- 3a1. System detects player connection problems or absence
- 3a2. GM receives notification of player status changes
- 3a3. GM can pause session to wait for player or continue without them
- 3a4. GM can invite replacement players if needed
- 3a5. Continue from step 4

### 4a. Session Pause/Break Management
- 4a1. GM initiates session pause for break or technical issues
- 4a2. System notifies all players of pause status
- 4a3. GM sets break duration or open-ended pause
- 4a4. GM resumes session when ready to continue
- 4a5. System notifies players of session resumption

### 6a. Emergency Session Management
- 6a1. GM encounters technical difficulties or emergency situation
- 6a2. GM uses emergency session controls (immediate pause, player ejection)
- 6a3. GM communicates situation to players through emergency messaging
- 6a4. GM either resolves issue and continues or ends session early
- 6a5. Continue based on resolution outcome

## Postconditions
**Success**: Session managed effectively, participants coordinated, gameplay flows smoothly
**Failure**: Session disrupted, participants confused, requires recovery or termination

## Business Rules
- Only session host/GM can control session state and player management
- Session state changes notify all participants in real-time
- Player kicks require confirmation to prevent accidental removal
- Session duration tracked for historical records and billing (if applicable)
- Emergency stop functionality available for critical situations
- Session recordings (if enabled) managed according to privacy settings

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **SessionDashboard**: Main interface for session management and monitoring
- **SessionControls**: Start, pause, resume, end session control buttons
- **PlayerManager**: Interface for managing connected players and permissions
- **SessionStatus**: Real-time display of session state and participant info
- **EmergencyControls**: Quick access emergency management tools
- **SessionTimer**: Session duration tracking with break time management
- **SceneController**: Interface for managing scene transitions during session
- **CommunicationPanel**: Integrated chat and communication controls

### API Integration Points
- **PUT** `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/start` - Start game session
- **PUT** `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/pause` - Pause ongoing session
- **PUT** `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/resume` - Resume paused session
- **PUT** `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/end` - End game session
- **GET** `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/participants` - Get current participant status
- **DELETE** `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/participants/{playerId}` - Remove player from session
- **POST** `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/invite` - Invite additional players during session
- **GET** `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/status` - Real-time session status

### State Management
- Session state management (not-started, active, paused, ended)
- Participant connection state with real-time updates
- Session control permission state
- Communication state integration
- Scene management state coordination
- Timer and duration tracking state

### Real-time Features
- SignalR integration for session state broadcasting
- Real-time participant status updates
- Live session control synchronization
- Instant messaging for session coordination
- Session event logging and history

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Session dashboard loads within 2 seconds and shows current session state
- [ ] Session start/pause/resume controls respond within 500ms
- [ ] Player connection status updates in real-time (within 5 seconds)
- [ ] Session timer displays accurate duration and break time tracking
- [ ] Player removal confirmation prevents accidental kicks
- [ ] Emergency stop functionality works even during system stress
- [ ] Session state changes broadcast to all participants within 2 seconds
- [ ] GM can invite additional players during active session
- [ ] Session controls remain responsive with up to 8 concurrent participants
- [ ] Session end process includes optional feedback collection
- [ ] All session management actions logged for audit purposes

## Error Handling Requirements
- Network connectivity issues during session management
- Player disconnection handling with automatic reconnection attempts
- Session state synchronization conflicts between participants
- System overload during peak session times with graceful degradation
