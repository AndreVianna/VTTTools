## Main Flow
1. User navigates to account settings from profile or dashboard
2. System displays current settings organized by category
3. User modifies desired settings (notifications, privacy, display preferences)
4. System validates setting changes in real-time
5. User saves updated settings
6. System applies new settings and provides confirmation
7. Changes take effect immediately across the application

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Invalid Setting Values:**
1. System detects invalid or incompatible setting combinations
2. System displays specific validation messages
3. System suggests valid alternatives or corrections
4. User adjusts settings to meet requirements

**A2 - Reset to Defaults:**
1. User chooses to reset settings to default values
2. System displays confirmation dialog with impact description
3. User confirms reset decision
4. System restores default settings and confirms changes

**A3 - Category-Specific Settings:**
1. User accesses specific setting category (audio, display, privacy)
2. System shows relevant settings with contextual help
3. User makes category-specific adjustments
4. System applies settings with immediate preview where applicable

## Postconditions
- Account settings are successfully updated
- Changes are applied across all application features
- User preferences persist across sessions
- Settings changes are logged for audit purposes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Profile information update forms with validation
- [ ] Account settings interface for preferences
- [ ] Password change functionality with current password verification

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Create modular settings components organized by category
- Use React Hook Form for settings management with validation
- Implement real-time setting preview where applicable
- Use React Context for settings state management across components
- Integrate with backend user preferences API
- Implement proper loading states for settings updates
- Create reusable settings input components (toggles, sliders, dropdowns)
- Add settings export/import functionality for backup
- Use proper validation and error handling for setting constraints
- Implement settings change tracking for user experience analytics
