**Primary Actor**: Any User  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Error Handling  
**Level**: System Feature  

## Preconditions
- User is using the VTTTools application
- System encounters internal errors or unexpected conditions

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Error Occurrence**: System encounters an unexpected error or exception
2. **Error Capture**: Error boundary or monitoring system captures the error details
3. **Error Analysis**: System analyzes error type and determines appropriate user response
4. **User-Friendly Translation**: System converts technical error into understandable message
5. **Error Display**: System presents clear, actionable error message to user
6. **Action Options**: System provides relevant options for user to proceed
7. **User Response**: User selects appropriate action based on provided options
8. **Resolution Tracking**: System tracks user's chosen resolution path

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Critical System Failure
- 2a1. System encounters critical error that prevents normal operation
- 2a2. Error boundary catches failure and prevents complete application crash
- 2a3. System displays emergency error interface with minimal functionality
- 2a4. System preserves user data and provides emergency save options
- 2a5. User can save work and restart application or contact support

### 3a. Recoverable Error
- 3a1. System determines error is recoverable through user action
- 3a2. System provides specific steps for user to resolve the issue
- 3a3. System offers to automatically retry operation after user confirmation
- 3a4. User follows resolution steps or accepts automatic retry
- 3a5. System monitors resolution success and provides feedback

### 5a. Error Context Provision
- 5a1. System includes relevant context about what user was doing when error occurred
- 5a2. System provides error reference ID for support communication
- 5a3. System suggests preventive measures to avoid similar errors
- 5a4. System offers to send error report to development team
- 5a5. Continue from step 6

### 7a. Support Integration
- 7a1. User selects option to get help with the error
- 7a2. System launches integrated support interface with error context
- 7a3. System pre-fills support request with relevant error information
- 7a4. User can add additional context and submit support request
- 7a5. System provides confirmation and expected response timeline

## Postconditions
**Success**: User understands the error and successfully proceeds with their task
**Partial Success**: User proceeds with limited functionality while error is being addressed
**Failure**: User understands they need expert assistance and knows how to get it

## Business Rules
- Error messages must never expose sensitive system information
- Technical details only shown to users with appropriate permissions
- All system errors must be logged for debugging and improvement
- Error messages should guide users toward successful task completion
- Critical errors that affect data integrity require immediate user attention
- Error recovery options prioritized by likelihood of success and data safety

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **SystemErrorBoundary**: Global error boundary catching unhandled React errors
- **ErrorDisplay**: Main component for showing user-friendly error messages
- **ErrorActions**: Component providing contextual action buttons
- **ErrorReporter**: Interface for users to report errors with additional context
- **EmergencyMode**: Minimal interface for critical system failures
- **ErrorLogger**: Component handling error logging and analytics
- **SupportIntegration**: Interface connecting users with support resources

### API Integration Points
- **POST** `/api/errors/report` - Submit error report with user context
- **GET** `/api/errors/guidance/{errorType}` - Retrieve specific error guidance
- **POST** `/api/support/create-ticket` - Create support ticket from error context
- **GET** `/api/system/health` - Check system health status for error context

### State Management
- Global error state with current error information
- Error recovery tracking with attempt history
- User error preferences and notification settings
- Support interaction state for integrated help
- Error analytics data for improvement insights

### Error Categorization
- **User Errors**: Mistakes in user input or workflow
- **System Errors**: Internal application or infrastructure failures
- **Network Errors**: Connectivity and communication failures
- **Security Errors**: Authentication and authorization failures
- **Data Errors**: Corruption or validation failures
