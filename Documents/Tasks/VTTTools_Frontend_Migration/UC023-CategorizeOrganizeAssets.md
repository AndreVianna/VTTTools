# UC023: Categorize and Organize Assets

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC023  
**Use Case Name**: Categorize and Organize Assets  
**User Story**: As a GM, I want to categorize and organize assets so that I can find them efficiently  
**Primary Actor**: Game Master (GM)  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Asset Management  
**Level**: User Task  

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated as a GM
- User has access to asset library
- Assets exist in the user's library

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Organization Access**: GM navigates to asset organization interface
2. **Category Management**: GM creates, edits, or manages asset categories/folders
3. **Asset Selection**: GM selects assets to categorize (single or multiple)
4. **Category Assignment**: GM assigns assets to categories using drag-drop or selection interface
5. **Tag Application**: GM applies descriptive tags to assets for enhanced searchability
6. **Organization Save**: System saves categorization changes and updates asset library
7. **View Update**: System refreshes asset library with new organizational structure

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Create New Category
- 2a1. GM clicks "Create Category" or "New Folder"
- 2a2. System displays category creation form
- 2a3. GM enters category name, description, and optional parent category
- 2a4. System validates category name uniqueness
- 2a5. Category created and available for asset assignment

### 2b. Edit Existing Category
- 2b1. GM selects existing category for editing
- 2b2. System displays category edit form with current properties
- 2b3. GM modifies category details
- 2b4. System validates changes and updates category
- 2b5. All assets in category remain properly associated

### 3a. Bulk Asset Selection
- 3a1. GM uses multi-select to choose multiple assets
- 3a2. System provides bulk categorization interface
- 3a3. GM applies categories/tags to all selected assets simultaneously
- 3a4. System processes bulk changes and provides progress feedback

### 4a. Drag and Drop Organization
- 4a1. GM drags assets from library to category folders
- 4a2. System provides visual feedback during drag operation
- 4a3. GM drops assets onto target category
- 4a4. System updates asset categorization immediately

## Postconditions
**Success**: Assets are properly categorized, tags applied, and organization reflected in library
**Failure**: Asset organization remains unchanged, user receives appropriate error feedback

## Business Rules
- Category names must be unique within the user's library
- Assets can belong to multiple categories (many-to-many relationship)
- Tags are free-form text but system suggests existing tags
- Category hierarchy supports up to 5 levels deep
- Deleted categories move contained assets to "Uncategorized"
- Tag suggestions prioritize frequently used tags

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **CategoryManager**: Main interface for creating and managing categories
- **AssetCategorizer**: Component for assigning categories to assets
- **TagEditor**: Interface for applying and managing tags
- **CategoryTree**: Hierarchical display of category structure
- **BulkCategorization**: Component for batch categorization operations
- **DragDropZone**: Drag-and-drop interface for organization

### API Integration Points
- **GET** `/api/assets/categories` - Retrieve user's category structure
- **POST** `/api/assets/categories` - Create new category
- **PUT** `/api/assets/categories/{categoryId}` - Update category details
- **DELETE** `/api/assets/categories/{categoryId}` - Delete category
- **PUT** `/api/assets/{assetId}/categories` - Update asset category assignments
- **GET** `/api/assets/tags` - Retrieve available tags with usage frequency
- **POST** `/api/assets/{assetId}/tags` - Apply tags to asset

### State Management
- Category hierarchy state with real-time updates
- Asset-to-category mapping state
- Tag autocomplete and suggestion state
- Bulk operation progress state
- Drag-and-drop operation state
- Filter and search state integration

### Organization Features
- Nested category/folder structure
- Color coding for categories (visual organization)
- Asset count indicators per category
- Quick-filter buttons for common categories
- Recently used categories for faster access

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Category creation completes within 2 seconds with immediate UI update
- [ ] Drag-and-drop asset categorization provides smooth visual feedback
- [ ] Bulk categorization processes at minimum 20 assets per second
- [ ] Tag autocomplete suggestions appear within 200ms of typing
- [ ] Category tree supports expand/collapse with state persistence
- [ ] Asset count per category updates in real-time as assets are moved
- [ ] Category renaming updates all associated assets immediately
- [ ] Tag search supports partial matching and fuzzy search
- [ ] Category deletion confirmation shows count of affected assets
- [ ] Organization changes sync immediately with Scene Builder asset browser
- [ ] Category hierarchy supports 5 levels with clear visual indication

## Error Handling Requirements
- Duplicate category name validation with suggested alternatives
- Network failures during category operations with retry mechanisms
- Invalid tag format handling with sanitization
- Bulk operation failures with partial success reporting
- Category deletion conflicts with dependency resolution
- Concurrent modification handling for shared categories

## Performance Requirements
- Category tree renders within 500ms for up to 100 categories
- Tag suggestions populate within 200ms of input
- Bulk categorization operations provide progress feedback >3 seconds
- Drag-and-drop operations complete within 1 second of drop
- Category filtering updates asset view within 300ms
- Organization changes persist within 2 seconds of user action

## Security Considerations  
- Validate category ownership before allowing modifications
- Sanitize category and tag names to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting for bulk categorization operations
- Log organization changes for audit purposes
- Prevent unauthorized access to other users' category structures

## Usability Requirements
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface with clear visual cues
- Keyboard shortcuts for common categorization actions
- Undo/redo support for organization changes
- Search integration that respects category filters
- Mobile-friendly touch interface for tablet users
- Accessibility support for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Quick-access toolbar for frequently used categories
- Visual indicators for assets without categories
