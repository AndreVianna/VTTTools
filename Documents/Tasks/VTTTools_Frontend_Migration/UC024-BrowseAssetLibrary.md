# UC024: Browse Asset Library

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC024  
**Use Case Name**: Browse Asset Library  
**User Story**: As a GM, I want to browse my asset library so that I can select appropriate assets for scenes  
**Primary Actor**: Game Master (GM)  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Asset Management  
**Level**: User Task  

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated as a GM
- User has access to asset library
- Asset library contains assets to browse

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Library Access**: GM navigates to asset library interface
2. **View Selection**: GM selects preferred view mode (grid, list, or detailed view)
3. **Asset Browsing**: GM browses through assets using pagination or infinite scroll
4. **Filter Application**: GM applies filters by type, category, or tags to narrow results
5. **Search Usage**: GM uses search functionality to find specific assets
6. **Asset Preview**: GM previews asset details and images without leaving browse view
7. **Asset Selection**: GM selects asset(s) for use in scenes or further action

## Alternative Flows

### 3a. Large Library Browsing
- 3a1. System implements virtual scrolling for performance with 1000+ assets
- 3a2. Assets load progressively as user scrolls
- 3a3. System maintains smooth scrolling performance
- 3a4. Continue from step 4

### 4a. Advanced Filtering
- 4a1. GM opens advanced filter panel
- 4a2. GM combines multiple filter criteria (type + category + date range)
- 4a3. System applies filters with AND/OR logic options
- 4a4. GM saves filter combinations for future use
- 4a5. Continue from step 6

### 5a. Search with Filters
- 5a1. GM enters search terms while filters are active
- 5a2. System searches within filtered results
- 5a3. Search highlights matching terms in asset names and descriptions
- 5a4. Continue from step 6

### 6a. Batch Preview Mode
- 6a1. GM enables comparison mode for multiple assets
- 6a2. System displays side-by-side preview of selected assets
- 6a3. GM can compare properties and images efficiently
- 6a4. Continue from step 7

## Postconditions
**Success**: GM has found and selected appropriate assets for their needs
**Failure**: GM unable to locate desired assets, receives guidance for alternative approaches

## Business Rules
- Asset library shows only assets owned by or shared with the user
- Recently used assets appear in quick-access section
- Asset thumbnails generate automatically for uploaded images
- Search includes asset names, descriptions, and tags
- Filter combinations are saved per user session
- Assets marked as "favorites" appear in priority sections

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **AssetLibrary**: Main container component with view management
- **AssetGrid**: Grid view component with thumbnail display
- **AssetList**: List view component with detailed information
- **AssetCard**: Individual asset display component
- **SearchBar**: Search input with autocomplete and filters
- **FilterPanel**: Advanced filtering interface
- **AssetPreview**: Modal or sidebar preview component
- **PaginationControls**: Navigation for large asset collections
- **ViewModeToggle**: Switch between different display modes

### API Integration Points
- **GET** `/api/assets` - Retrieve asset library with pagination/filtering
- **GET** `/api/assets/search` - Search assets with query parameters
- **GET** `/api/assets/{assetId}/preview` - Get asset preview details
- **GET** `/api/assets/filters` - Retrieve available filter options
- **POST** `/api/assets/favorites/{assetId}` - Mark asset as favorite
- **GET** `/api/assets/recent` - Get recently used assets

### State Management
- Asset library state with caching for performance
- Search and filter state with URL persistence
- View mode and pagination state
- Asset selection state for multi-select operations
- Preview state management
- Favorite assets state with local storage backup

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for large asset collections
- Image lazy loading with placeholder thumbnails
- Debounced search input (300ms)
- Cached filter results with intelligent invalidation
- Progressive image quality loading (low-res then high-res)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Asset library loads initial view within 2 seconds
- [ ] Grid view displays 20-50 assets per page depending on screen size
- [ ] List view shows detailed asset information in table format
- [ ] Search results appear within 500ms of query completion
- [ ] Filter application updates results within 300ms
- [ ] Asset thumbnails load progressively with fallback placeholders
- [ ] Infinite scroll maintains 60fps performance with 500+ assets
- [ ] Asset preview opens within 1 second and shows full details
- [ ] Multi-select allows selection of up to 50 assets for bulk operations
- [ ] Recently used assets section shows last 10 accessed items
- [ ] Favorite assets can be toggled with immediate visual feedback
- [ ] View mode preferences persist across browser sessions

## Error Handling Requirements
- Asset loading failures with retry mechanism and placeholder display
- Search service unavailability with fallback to local filtering
- Large result set timeouts with progressive loading options
- Image loading failures with fallback icons based on asset type
- Filter service errors with graceful degradation
- Network connectivity issues with offline browsing of cached assets

## Performance Requirements
- Initial page load within 2 seconds for libraries up to 1000 assets
- Search response time under 500ms for typical queries
- Smooth scrolling at 60fps with virtual scrolling implementation
- Image thumbnail loading under 200ms per asset
- Filter application response under 300ms
- Pagination navigation under 1 second between pages

## Security Considerations  
- Validate user permissions before showing assets in library
- Sanitize search queries to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting for search and filter operations
- Secure image URLs with appropriate access controls
- Log asset access for audit purposes
- Prevent unauthorized access to private asset collections

## Usability Requirements
- Keyboard navigation support for accessibility
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- Touch-friendly interface for tablet browsing
- Responsive design adapting to different screen sizes
- Contextual help for search and filter features
- Drag-and-drop selection for Scene Builder integration
- Quick action buttons for common operations (edit, delete, favorite)
- Breadcrumb navigation for category-based browsing
- Asset count indicators showing filtered vs total results
- Clear visual distinction between asset types and states
