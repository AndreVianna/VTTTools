# UC035: Scene Saving/Loading Error Recovery

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC035  
**Use Case Name**: Scene Saving/Loading Error Recovery  
**User Story**: As a GM, I want to recover from scene saving/loading errors so that I don't lose my work when technical issues occur  
**Primary Actor**: Game Master (GM)  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Error Handling  
**Level**: User Task  

## Preconditions
- GM is working with scenes in Scene Builder
- Scene data exists that needs to be saved or loaded
- Technical issues may occur during save/load operations

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Operation Attempt**: GM initiates scene save or load operation
2. **Error Detection**: System detects failure during save/load process
3. **Immediate Protection**: System prevents data loss by preserving current state
4. **User Notification**: System notifies GM of the error with specific details
5. **Recovery Options**: System presents multiple recovery options appropriate to the error
6. **Recovery Selection**: GM selects preferred recovery method
7. **Recovery Execution**: System attempts to recover scene data using selected method
8. **Verification**: System verifies recovery success and data integrity
9. **Confirmation**: GM confirms recovered scene is correct and continues work

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Auto-save Failure
- 2a1. System's automatic save operation fails in background
- 2a2. System logs failure and switches to local backup storage
- 2a3. System continues operation using local state preservation
- 2a4. System notifies GM of auto-save failure without interrupting workflow
- 2a5. GM can choose to address immediately or continue working

### 3a. Complete Data Corruption
- 3a1. System detects scene data corruption during load attempt
- 3a2. System immediately creates backup of corrupted data for analysis
- 3a3. System searches for previous valid version or auto-save backup
- 3a4. System presents timeline of available backups to GM
- 3a5. GM selects backup version to restore from

### 5a. Multiple Recovery Options
- 5a1. System identifies several potential recovery methods
- 5a2. System ranks recovery options by likelihood of success and data completeness
- 5a3. System displays options with clear explanations of what each will restore
- 5a4. GM can preview recovery results before committing to specific option
- 5a5. Continue from step 6 with GM's selection

### 7a. Recovery Failure
- 7a1. Selected recovery method fails to restore scene properly
- 7a2. System reports specific recovery failure details
- 7a3. System offers alternative recovery methods if available
- 7a4. GM can try different recovery approach or contact support
- 7a5. System preserves all recovery attempts for expert assistance

## Postconditions
**Success**: Scene data recovered successfully, GM can continue working with minimal data loss
**Partial Success**: Scene partially recovered, GM informed of any lost elements
**Failure**: GM understands recovery limitations and has options for expert assistance

## Business Rules
- Scene data must never be completely lost without user confirmation
- Auto-save frequency increases during active editing sessions
- Recovery operations maintain audit trail for debugging and improvement
- Critical scene elements (backgrounds, player tokens) prioritized in recovery
- Recovery options presented in order of data completeness and reliability
- All recovery attempts logged for system improvement and support

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **SceneErrorRecovery**: Main recovery interface with option selection
- **BackupTimeline**: Component showing available backup versions with timestamps
- **RecoveryProgress**: Progress indicator for recovery operations
- **DataIntegrityChecker**: Component for validating recovered scene data
- **RecoveryPreview**: Preview component showing what will be recovered
- **ErrorAnalyzer**: Component analyzing and categorizing scene errors
- **LocalBackupManager**: Interface for managing client-side scene backups

### API Integration Points
- **GET** `/api/scenes/{sceneId}/backups` - Retrieve available scene backups
- **POST** `/api/scenes/{sceneId}/recover/{backupId}` - Initiate scene recovery
- **GET** `/api/scenes/{sceneId}/validate` - Validate scene data integrity
- **POST** `/api/scenes/emergency-save` - Emergency save with error context
- **GET** `/api/scenes/{sceneId}/recovery-options` - Get available recovery methods

### State Management
- Scene recovery state with multiple backup options
- Recovery progress tracking with detailed status updates
- Local backup state for client-side scene preservation
- Error analysis state with categorized failure types
- Recovery history for debugging and pattern analysis

### Backup and Recovery Features
- Automatic incremental backups during editing sessions
- Client-side local storage backup as failsafe
- Version control with branching for recovery points
- Integrity checking with checksum validation
- Selective recovery of specific scene elements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scene save failures detected within 5 seconds of operation start
- [ ] Auto-save creates backup every 2 minutes during active editing
- [ ] Recovery options display within 10 seconds of error detection
- [ ] Local backup prevents complete data loss even during network failures
- [ ] Recovery preview shows accurate representation of recoverable data
- [ ] Scene integrity validation completes within 15 seconds for complex scenes
- [ ] Emergency save preserves current state within 3 seconds of system detection
- [ ] Recovery operations complete within 30 seconds or provide progress updates
- [ ] Backup timeline shows clear timestamps and scene modification descriptions
- [ ] Data loss limited to maximum 5 minutes of work with proper auto-save function
- [ ] Recovery success rate >95% for typical network and server failures

## Error Types and Recovery Strategies

### Network Timeout During Save
- **Detection**: Save operation exceeds 30-second timeout
- **Recovery**: Retry with exponential backoff, use local backup if persistent
- **User Action**: Option to save locally and sync later

### Server Storage Full
- **Detection**: Server returns storage quota exceeded error
- **Recovery**: Compress scene data, use delta saves, prompt for cleanup
- **User Action**: Delete old scenes or upgrade storage

### Corrupted Scene Data
- **Detection**: Data validation fails during load
- **Recovery**: Use previous valid backup, attempt partial data recovery
- **User Action**: Select backup version, report corruption for analysis

### Concurrent Edit Conflict
- **Detection**: Scene modified by another user during save
- **Recovery**: Merge changes where possible, present conflict resolution
- **User Action**: Choose version or merge manually

### Browser Crash Recovery
- **Detection**: Application restart with unsaved changes detected
- **Recovery**: Restore from local storage auto-save
- **User Action**: Confirm restoration or start fresh

## Error Handling Requirements
- Graceful handling of partial scene corruption with selective recovery
- Protection against infinite recovery loops
- Clear communication of what data may be lost in each recovery option

- Recovery operations validate user permissions before execution
- Audit logging for all recovery operations and data access
- Secure deletion of corrupted data after successful recovery
- Protection against recovery data tampering or manipulation

## Data Integrity Requirements
- Checksum validation for all scene data during save/load
- Version control maintaining scene history for rollback
- Atomic save operations preventing partial corruption
- Backup verification ensuring backup data validity
