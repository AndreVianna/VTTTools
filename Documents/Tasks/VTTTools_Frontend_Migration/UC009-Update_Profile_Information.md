# Use Case UC009: Update Profile Information

## Actor
User (authenticated user)

## Goal
Update personal profile information so that other players can identify and interact with them correctly in the gaming environment

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated and has access to profile settings
- User has an existing profile with current information
- Profile service is available

## Main Flow
1. User navigates to profile settings from dashboard or account menu
2. System displays current profile information in editable form
3. User modifies desired profile fields (name, display name, bio, etc.)
4. System validates changes in real-time
5. User saves updated profile information
6. System validates and updates profile data
7. System displays confirmation of successful update
8. Updated information is reflected across the application

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Validation Errors:**
1. System detects invalid or incomplete profile data
2. System displays specific validation errors for each field
3. System provides guidance for correction
4. User corrects issues and resubmits changes

**A2 - Conflicting Information:**
1. Updated information conflicts with existing constraints
2. System displays conflict resolution options
3. User chooses how to resolve conflicts
4. System processes resolution and updates profile

**A3 - Partial Updates:**
1. User makes changes but navigates away without saving
2. System detects unsaved changes and shows warning
3. User chooses to save, discard, or continue editing
4. System processes user decision appropriately

## Postconditions
- User profile information is successfully updated
- Changes are reflected across all application features
- Other users see updated profile information
- Profile history is maintained for audit purposes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Profile information update forms with validation
- [ ] Account settings interface for preferences
- [ ] Password change functionality with current password verification

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Use React Hook Form for profile editing with validation
- Implement real-time field validation with debouncing
- Create reusable profile form components
- Integrate with VttTools.Auth microservice user management
- Use optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Implement proper loading states for profile updates
- Add confirmation dialogs for significant profile changes
- Use React Query for profile data caching and synchronization
- Implement profile image upload with preview functionality
- Add proper accessibility attributes for form elements
