# UC041 - Access Contextual Help

## Use Case Information
- **Use Case ID**: UC041
- **Use Case Name**: Access Contextual Help
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to access contextual help for complex features so that I can understand how to use advanced functionality
- **Actor(s)**: All authenticated users (GMs and Players)
- **System**: VTTTools React Frontend Application

## Preconditions
- User is logged into the VTTTools application
- User is actively using a feature that has contextual help available
- Help system is loaded and accessible

## Postconditions
- User has accessed relevant help content for their current context
- Help content is displayed in a non-intrusive manner
- User can continue their workflow while referencing help information
- User understanding of the feature is improved

## Main Flow
1. **User encounters complex feature** (Scene Builder, Asset Management, Adventure Creation, etc.)
2. **System detects user context** and makes contextual help available
3. **User activates help** through help icon, keyboard shortcut (F1), or right-click menu
4. **System displays relevant help** in context-appropriate format (sidebar, modal, overlay)
5. **User reviews help content** while maintaining access to the feature
6. **User applies learned information** to continue their workflow
7. **System maintains help availability** for continued reference

## Alternative Flows
### A1: Help Not Available for Current Context
3a. System displays message "No specific help available for this feature"
3b. System offers general application help or suggests contacting support
3c. User continues with general help or returns to workflow

### A2: Multiple Help Topics Available
4a. System displays help topic menu for current context
4b. User selects specific help topic
4c. System displays selected help content

### A3: Help Content Loading Error
4a. System displays error message about help content unavailability
4b. System offers offline help or cached content if available
4c. User can retry loading or continue without help

## Technical Implementation Notes

### React Component Architecture
```typescript
interface ContextualHelpProps {
  context: HelpContext;
  trigger: 'icon' | 'keyboard' | 'contextmenu';
  position: 'sidebar' | 'modal' | 'overlay';
}

enum HelpContext {
  SceneBuilder = 'scene-builder',
  AssetManagement = 'asset-management',
  AdventureCreation = 'adventure-creation',
  GameSession = 'game-session',
  UserProfile = 'user-profile'
}
```

### Help Content Management
- **Content Storage**: JSON-based help content with markdown support
- **Context Detection**: Route-based and component-based context identification
- **Search Integration**: Full-text search within contextual help content
- **Caching**: Client-side caching of frequently accessed help topics

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Non-intrusive Display**: Help appears without blocking workflow
- **Responsive Design**: Help adapts to screen size and available space
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic help first, detailed information on demand

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Contextual help panels display relevant documentation for current feature context
- [ ] Feature-specific guidance is accessible from relevant UI contexts without navigation
- [ ] Help system integration works entirely within the application (no external links required)
- [ ] Help content loads and displays within 2 seconds of user activation
- [ ] Help remains accessible throughout feature usage without interrupting workflow

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Help activation methods include: help icon, F1 key, right-click context menu
- [ ] Help content displays in context-appropriate format (sidebar for Scene Builder, modal for forms)
- [ ] User can interact with both help content and main feature simultaneously
- [ ] Help content is searchable within the contextual scope
- [ ] Help can be dismissed while maintaining current workflow state

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Help system integrates with React Router for context detection
- [ ] Help content is cached locally for offline availability
- [ ] Help system performs efficiently with minimal impact on application performance
- [ ] Help content supports markdown formatting for rich documentation
- [ ] Help system tracks usage analytics for content improvement

### Content Requirements
- [ ] Scene Builder help covers canvas operations, asset manipulation, and grid systems
- [ ] Asset Management help covers upload, organization, and property editing
- [ ] Adventure Management help covers creation, editing, and collaboration features
- [ ] Form validation help provides specific guidance for error resolution
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut help displays current context-relevant shortcuts

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Help content loading does not impact main application performance
- [ ] Help system memory usage remains under 10MB for all cached content
- [ ] Help search returns results within 500ms for queries
- [ ] Help content rendering maintains 60fps during animations and transitions

### Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] Help system works with keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Help content is screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] High contrast mode support for help content display
- [ ] Focus management maintains usability when help is activated/dismissed

## Business Value
- **Reduced User Friction**: Users can get immediate help without leaving their workflow
- **Improved Feature Adoption**: Complex features become more accessible with contextual guidance
- **Reduced Support Burden**: Self-service help reduces need for direct support
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Seamless integration maintains workflow continuity
- **Feature Discovery**: Users discover advanced functionality through contextual suggestions

## Dependencies
- **Content Management System**: Help content creation and maintenance workflow
- **Analytics Integration**: Usage tracking for help content effectiveness
- **Search Infrastructure**: Full-text search capabilities within help content
- **Caching Strategy**: Efficient content caching and update mechanisms

## Risk Factors
- **Content Maintenance**: Help content must stay synchronized with feature updates
- **Performance Impact**: Help system must not degrade application performance
- **Context Detection**: Accurate context identification critical for relevant help
- **User Adoption**: Users must discover and adopt help system for value realization
