# UC050 - Asset Library Browsing Integration

## Use Case Information
- **Use Case ID**: UC050
- **Use Case Name**: Asset Library Browsing Integration
- **User Story**: As a GM, I want to browse and select assets from my library so that I can efficiently choose elements for my scenes
- **Actor(s)**: Game Master (GM)
- **System**: VTTTools React Frontend Application - Scene Builder Asset Integration

## Preconditions
- GM is logged into the VTTTools application
- Scene Builder is open with canvas, background, and grid configured
- GM has assets available in their library (Characters, Creatures, NPCs, Objects)
- Asset management system is operational with API endpoints available

## Postconditions
- GM has browsed their asset library within Scene Builder interface
- Selected assets are ready for placement on the scene canvas
- Asset metadata and images are cached for efficient placement
- Asset selection state is maintained throughout scene building session
- Integration maintains performance despite large asset libraries

## Main Flow
1. **GM opens asset library browser** from Scene Builder toolbar or "Add Asset" button
2. **System displays asset browser modal** with categories and search interface
3. **System loads asset thumbnails** from GM's asset library with pagination
4. **GM browses assets** using category filters, search, or scrolling
5. **GM previews asset details** by hovering or clicking for expanded view
6. **GM selects assets** for scene placement (single or multi-select)
7. **System prepares selected assets** with metadata and rendering data
8. **GM closes asset browser** with assets ready for canvas placement
9. **System maintains asset selection** for immediate placement workflow

## Alternative Flows
### A1: Asset Search and Filtering
4a. GM enters search terms in asset search field
4b. System filters assets by name, tags, and categories in real-time
4c. GM applies category filters (Character, Creature, NPC, Object)
4d. Filtered results update instantly with matching assets

### A2: Asset Preview Mode
5a. GM clicks asset for detailed preview
5b. System displays expanded view with full image and metadata
5c. Preview shows asset properties, tags, and usage statistics
5d. GM can select asset directly from preview or return to browser

### A3: Multi-Asset Selection
6a. GM holds Ctrl/Cmd while clicking multiple assets
6b. System highlights selected assets with selection indicators
6c. GM can deselect assets by clicking again while holding modifier
6d. Selection count and summary display in browser interface

### A4: Asset Loading Performance
3a. System detects large asset library requiring performance optimization
3b. System implements lazy loading with placeholder thumbnails
3c. System loads assets in viewport-priority order
3d. Background loading continues for off-screen assets

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Asset Browser Architecture
```typescript
interface AssetBrowserProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onAssetsSelected: (assets: Asset[]) => void;
  selectedAssets: Asset[];
  filters: AssetFilters;
}

interface AssetFilters {
  category?: AssetCategory;
  searchQuery?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  sortBy?: 'name' | 'created' | 'used' | 'updated';
  sortOrder?: 'asc' | 'desc';
}

interface AssetGridItem {
  asset: Asset;
  thumbnailUrl: string;
  isSelected: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error?: string;
}

const AssetBrowser: React.FC<AssetBrowserProps> = ({
  isOpen, onClose, onAssetsSelected, selectedAssets, filters
}) => {
  const [assets, setAssets] = useState<Asset[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  // Asset loading, filtering, and selection logic
};
```

### API Integration Strategy
- **Asset Management API**: Integration with existing asset service endpoints
- **Thumbnail Caching**: Efficient thumbnail loading and browser caching
- **Search Integration**: Real-time search with debounced API calls
- **Pagination**: Virtual scrolling for large asset collections
- **Category Filtering**: API-based filtering with client-side refinement

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Load thumbnails as they enter viewport
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle thousands of assets efficiently
- **Image Caching**: Browser and memory caching for thumbnails
- **Search Debouncing**: Prevent excessive API calls during typing
- **Background Loading**: Continue loading assets during user interaction

### UI/UX Integration
- **Modal Design**: Non-blocking overlay that integrates with Scene Builder
- **Responsive Grid**: Asset thumbnails adapt to browser size and user preferences
- **Selection State**: Clear visual feedback for selected assets
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and progressive loading indicators

## Acceptance Criteria

### Browser Interface Integration
- [ ] Asset browser modal integrates seamlessly within Scene Builder interface without disrupting canvas workflow
- [ ] Asset browser displays with consistent design matching Scene Builder visual style
- [ ] Modal positioning allows simultaneous view of asset browser and scene canvas
- [ ] Browser opens and closes smoothly with appropriate animations and transitions
- [ ] Interface remains responsive during asset loading and browsing operations

### Asset Display and Navigation
- [ ] Asset category filtering provides clear organization (Character, Creature, NPC, Object types)
- [ ] Asset search functionality searches by name, tags, and metadata with instant results
- [ ] Asset preview displays image thumbnails (150x150px) with metadata overlay
- [ ] Asset grid layout adapts responsively to browser modal size and user preferences
- [ ] Pagination or infinite scrolling handles large asset libraries (500+ assets) efficiently

### Selection and Preview Features
- [ ] Asset selection interface supports both single-click and multi-select (Ctrl/Cmd+click) operations
- [ ] Selected assets display clear visual indicators (checkmarks, borders, highlighting)
- [ ] Asset preview expands on hover or click showing full image and complete metadata
- [ ] Multi-select displays selection count and provides "Select All" and "Clear Selection" options
- [ ] Asset selection state persists while browsing different categories and search results

### Performance and Loading
- [ ] Integration with existing asset management API endpoints maintains sub-2-second load times
- [ ] Asset loading states provide appropriate feedback (skeleton screens, progress indicators)
- [ ] Thumbnail loading uses lazy loading for assets outside viewport to optimize performance
- [ ] Asset browser handles 1000+ assets without performance degradation or UI lag
- [ ] Error handling covers network failures, missing assets, and corrupted images gracefully

### Search and Filtering
- [ ] Real-time search filters assets as user types with 300ms debouncing for performance
- [ ] Category filters work independently and in combination with search terms
- [ ] Tag-based filtering allows precise asset discovery based on GM's organization system
- [ ] Search results highlight matching terms in asset names and descriptions
- [ ] Filter reset options allow quick return to full asset library view

### Integration Requirements  
- [ ] Asset browser coordinates with Scene Builder canvas for seamless asset placement workflow
- [ ] Selected assets prepare for immediate canvas placement with required rendering data
- [ ] Asset metadata and images cache efficiently for repeated Scene Builder sessions
- [ ] Browser state preserves user preferences (category, search terms, view mode) across sessions
- [ ] Integration maintains existing asset management permissions and access controls

## Business Value
