**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Game Session Management  
**Level**: User Task  

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated as a GM
- A game session has been created or is being scheduled
- GM has access to player contact information or platform user directory

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Invitation Interface**: GM accesses player invitation interface from session management
2. **Player Search**: GM searches for players using name, email, or username
3. **Player Selection**: GM selects players from search results, friends list, or gaming groups
4. **Invitation Customization**: GM adds personal message and session-specific details
5. **Permission Setting**: GM configures player roles and permissions for the session
6. **Invitation Send**: GM sends invitations to selected players
7. **Response Tracking**: GM monitors invitation responses and player confirmations
8. **Follow-up Management**: GM manages responses, sends reminders, and handles waitlists

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Group-based Invitation
- 2a1. GM selects entire gaming group instead of individual players
- 2a2. System displays group members with individual selection options
- 2a3. GM can exclude specific members or include additional players
- 2a4. System prepares bulk invitation with group context
- 2a5. Continue from step 4

### 3a. External Player Invitation
- 3a1. GM invites players not yet registered on platform
- 3a2. GM enters email addresses for external invitations
- 3a3. System creates guest invitation with platform registration links
- 3a4. External players receive invitation with signup instructions
- 3a5. Continue from step 6

### 5a. Role-specific Permissions
- 5a1. GM assigns specific roles (Player, Co-GM, Observer) to invitees
- 5a2. System configures permissions based on assigned roles
- 5a3. GM customizes individual permissions if needed
- 5a4. Permission details included in invitation message
- 5a5. Continue from step 6

### 7a. Invitation Response Management
- 7a1. Players respond to invitations (Accept, Decline, Maybe)
- 7a2. System updates GM with real-time response notifications
- 7a3. GM adjusts session planning based on responses
- 7a4. GM can send targeted follow-ups to non-responders
- 7a5. Continue from step 8

## Postconditions
**Success**: Players invited successfully, responses tracked, gaming group assembled
**Failure**: Invitations failed to send, players unable to respond, group assembly incomplete

## Business Rules
- Maximum 8 players can be invited per session (configurable)
- Invitations expire 48 hours before session start time
- Players can only accept invitations for sessions they have permission to join
- GMs can rescind invitations until session starts
- System prevents duplicate invitations to same players for same session
- Invitation responses are tracked and stored for future reference
