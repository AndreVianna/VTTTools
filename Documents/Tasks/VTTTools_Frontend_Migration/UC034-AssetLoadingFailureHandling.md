# UC034: Asset Loading Failure Handling

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC034  
**Use Case Name**: Asset Loading Failure Handling  
**User Story**: As a user, I want to see helpful messages when assets fail to load so that I know which content is unavailable and can retry or choose alternatives  
**Primary Actor**: Any User  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Error Handling  
**Level**: System Feature  

## Preconditions
- User is attempting to access, view, or use assets within the application
- Assets are stored remotely and require network loading

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Asset Request**: User or system attempts to load an asset (image, audio, etc.)
2. **Loading Failure**: Asset fails to load due to network, server, or file issues
3. **Error Detection**: System detects and categorizes the loading failure
4. **Placeholder Display**: System shows appropriate placeholder with error indication
5. **Error Communication**: System displays helpful error message explaining the issue
6. **Recovery Options**: System presents retry, alternative, or fallback options
7. **User Action**: User selects preferred recovery action
8. **Resolution**: System attempts resolution or provides alternative content

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Partial Asset Loading
- 2a1. Asset begins loading but stalls or loads incompletely
- 2a2. System detects incomplete load after timeout period
- 2a3. System shows partial content with loading indicator and error state
- 2a4. User can choose to wait longer, retry, or use alternative
- 2a5. Continue from step 6

### 3a. Multiple Asset Failures
- 3a1. Multiple assets fail to load simultaneously (common in Scene Builder)
- 3a2. System batches error handling to avoid overwhelming user
- 3a3. System provides bulk retry option for all failed assets
- 3a4. System prioritizes critical assets for user attention
- 3a5. Continue from step 5

### 6a. Automatic Retry
- 6a1. System automatically attempts to reload failed asset
- 6a2. System uses exponential backoff for retry attempts
- 6a3. System shows retry progress to user
- 6a4. If retry succeeds, asset loads normally; if fails, continue from step 6
- 6a5. User can cancel automatic retry if desired

### 8a. Alternative Asset Suggestion
- 8a1. System analyzes failed asset and suggests similar alternatives
- 8a2. System displays alternative assets from user's library
- 8a3. User selects alternative asset as replacement
- 8a4. System updates references to use alternative asset
- 8a5. User workflow continues with alternative content

## Postconditions
**Success**: Asset loads successfully or user continues with acceptable alternative
**Failure**: User understands asset unavailability and has clear options for proceeding

## Business Rules
- Asset loading failures should not break user workflows
- Critical assets (required for functionality) get priority retry mechanisms
- Decorative assets can gracefully degrade without blocking user actions
- Asset placeholders must clearly indicate the type of missing content
- Users should have multiple recovery options appropriate to the context
- Failed asset information should be logged for system improvement

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **AssetErrorBoundary**: Error boundary specifically for asset loading failures
- **AssetPlaceholder**: Placeholder component showing asset loading state and errors
- **RetryControls**: Interface for asset retry operations with progress feedback
- **AlternativeAssetSelector**: Component for selecting replacement assets
- **BulkRetryInterface**: Interface for retrying multiple failed assets
- **AssetErrorNotification**: Non-intrusive notification for asset failures
- **FallbackAssetProvider**: Component managing fallback asset logic

### API Integration Points
- **GET** `/api/assets/{assetId}/status` - Check asset availability and status
- **POST** `/api/assets/{assetId}/retry` - Trigger asset reload attempt
- **GET** `/api/assets/alternatives/{assetId}` - Get suggested alternative assets
- **PUT** `/api/assets/{assetId}/replace/{newAssetId}` - Replace failed asset with alternative

### State Management
- Asset loading state with error tracking per asset
- Retry attempt counting with backoff timing
- Alternative asset suggestions and selection state
- Batch operation state for multiple asset failures
- User preference state for error handling behavior

### Asset Loading Features
- Progressive loading with quality degradation options
- Lazy loading with error handling for off-screen assets
- Caching strategies with cache validation and refresh
- CDN failover for redundant asset delivery

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Asset loading failures detected within 10 seconds of request
- [ ] Error placeholders appear immediately when loading fails
- [ ] Error messages specify the type of failure (network, not found, corrupted)
- [ ] Retry mechanism with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s intervals)
- [ ] Alternative asset suggestions load within 3 seconds
- [ ] Bulk retry processes up to 20 assets with progress tracking
- [ ] Asset placeholders maintain proper dimensions and layout
- [ ] Critical asset failures prioritized over decorative asset failures
- [ ] Asset error state persists across page navigation until resolved
- [ ] Failed asset references updated automatically when alternatives selected
- [ ] Scene Builder continues functioning with asset placeholder representations

## Asset Error Types and Handling

### Network Connection Failure
- **Placeholder**: Network error icon with asset type indicator
- **Message**: "Unable to load [asset name] - check connection"
- **Actions**: Retry, Use cached version, Select alternative

### Asset Not Found (404)
- **Placeholder**: Missing file icon with asset type
- **Message**: "[Asset name] is no longer available"
- **Actions**: Select alternative, Remove from scene, Contact support

### Asset Corrupted or Invalid
- **Placeholder**: Corrupted file icon with warning
- **Message**: "[Asset name] appears to be damaged"
- **Actions**: Re-upload asset, Select alternative, Report issue

### Server Error (5xx)
- **Placeholder**: Server error icon
- **Message**: "Temporary server issue loading [asset name]"
- **Actions**: Retry automatically, Try later, Use alternative

### Permission Denied
- **Placeholder**: Lock icon indicating access restriction
- **Message**: "You don't have permission to access [asset name]"
- **Actions**: Contact owner, Select alternative, Remove reference

## Error Handling Requirements
- Graceful degradation maintaining application functionality
- Asset error isolation preventing cascade failures
- Smart retry logic avoiding server overload
- Fallback asset systems for common asset types
- Error reporting for asset management and improvement

## Performance Requirements
- Error detection within 10 seconds of loading timeout
- Placeholder display within 500ms of error detection
- Retry operations complete within 30 seconds or provide clear feedback
- Alternative asset loading within 5 seconds
- Bulk operations maintain UI responsiveness with progress indicators

## Security Considerations  
- Asset URL validation to prevent malicious content loading
- Error message sanitization avoiding information disclosure
- Rate limiting for asset retry operations
- Secure fallback asset delivery mechanisms
- Asset access permission validation during error recovery

## User Experience Requirements
- Clear visual distinction between loading, error, and missing states
- Non-blocking error handling that allows continued workflow
- Contextual error messages relevant to user's current task
- Consistent error handling across all asset types and contexts
- Helpful recovery suggestions based on asset usage context

## Integration Requirements
- Scene Builder integration maintaining canvas functionality with failed assets
- Asset library integration showing error states in browsing
- Upload system integration for replacing failed assets
- Real-time collaboration handling of shared asset failures

## Accessibility Requirements
- Screen reader descriptions for asset error states
- High contrast error indicators and placeholders
- Keyboard navigation for error recovery actions
- Alternative text describing missing asset content
- Focus management for error correction workflows

## Asset Type Specific Handling
- **Images**: Show broken image placeholder with dimensions maintained
- **Audio**: Display audio controls with error state and alternative options
- **3D Models**: Show wireframe or simple geometry placeholder
- **Textures**: Use solid color or pattern fallback maintaining material properties
- **Animations**: Provide static frame or description placeholder
