# UC032: Network Connection Error Handling

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC032  
**Use Case Name**: Network Connection Error Handling  
**User Story**: As a user, I want to see clear error messages when network connections fail so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action  
**Primary Actor**: Any User  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Error Handling  
**Level**: System Feature  

## Preconditions
- User is using the VTTTools application
- Network connectivity issues occur during application usage

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Error Detection**: System detects network connectivity failure or timeout
2. **Error Classification**: System categorizes the type of network error (offline, timeout, server unavailable)
3. **User Notification**: System displays clear, user-friendly error message explaining the issue
4. **Action Options**: System presents appropriate recovery actions (retry, offline mode, contact support)
5. **Retry Mechanism**: User selects retry option, system attempts to reconnect
6. **Recovery Success**: Connection restored, user can continue with their task
7. **Status Update**: System confirms successful reconnection to user

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Partial Connectivity
- 2a1. System detects slow or intermittent connection
- 2a2. System displays warning about connection quality
- 2a3. User can choose to continue with degraded experience or wait for better connection
- 2a4. System adjusts functionality based on connection quality
- 2a5. Continue monitoring connection status

### 4a. Offline Mode Available
- 4a1. System offers offline mode for compatible features
- 4a2. User accepts offline mode operation
- 4a3. System switches to offline functionality with cached data
- 4a4. System queues operations for synchronization when connection returns
- 4a5. User continues with limited but functional experience

### 5a. Automatic Retry
- 5a1. System automatically attempts reconnection with exponential backoff
- 5a2. System shows retry progress and countdown to user
- 5a3. User can cancel automatic retry if desired
- 5a4. System reports results of automatic retry attempts
- 5a5. If successful, continue from step 6; if failed, return to step 4

### 6a. Persistent Connection Issues
- 6a1. Multiple retry attempts fail over extended period
- 6a2. System suggests alternative troubleshooting steps
- 6a3. System offers to preserve user work and enable offline mode
- 6a4. User can choose to continue troubleshooting or work offline
- 6a5. System maintains error state with periodic retry checks

## Postconditions
**Success**: Network connection restored, user can continue normal application usage
**Partial Success**: User continues with limited offline functionality
**Failure**: User understands network issues and has clear next steps for resolution

## Business Rules
- Error messages must be non-technical and actionable for end users
- System should attempt automatic recovery before requiring user intervention
- Critical user data must be preserved during network interruptions
- Offline functionality should be available for essential features when possible
- Error reporting should help diagnose network vs. server vs. application issues

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **NetworkErrorBoundary**: Error boundary specifically for network-related failures
- **ConnectionMonitor**: Component for real-time connection status monitoring
- **ErrorNotification**: User-friendly error message display with action buttons
- **RetryInterface**: Interface for manual and automatic retry operations
- **OfflineMode**: Component managing offline functionality and sync queue
- **ConnectivityIndicator**: Visual indicator showing current connection status
- **TroubleshootingGuide**: Component providing step-by-step problem resolution

### API Integration Points
- **GET** `/api/health/ping` - Simple connectivity check endpoint
- **GET** `/api/health/status` - Detailed system status information
- **POST** `/api/errors/report` - Report network errors for monitoring
- **GET** `/api/offline/sync` - Synchronize offline changes when connection returns

### State Management
- Connection status state (online, offline, degraded, reconnecting)
- Error state with categorized error types and messages
- Retry attempt tracking with backoff timing
- Offline operation queue for synchronization
- User preference state for error handling behavior

### Network Monitoring
- Real-time connectivity detection using browser APIs
- Periodic health checks to backend services
- Connection quality assessment (latency, bandwidth)
- Service availability monitoring with fallback detection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Network errors detected within 5 seconds of occurrence
- [ ] Error messages display within 2 seconds of detection
- [ ] Error messages use plain language avoiding technical jargon
- [ ] Retry mechanism provides visual feedback and progress indication
- [ ] Automatic retry uses exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s intervals)
- [ ] Offline mode preserves user work with automatic sync when reconnected
- [ ] Connection status indicator shows current state clearly in UI
- [ ] Error messages include specific actions user can take
- [ ] System distinguishes between different error types (timeout, offline, server down)
- [ ] Critical user actions (save, submit) protected with confirmation dialogs during network issues
- [ ] Error reporting captures relevant diagnostic information without exposing sensitive data

## Error Types and Messages

### Connection Timeout
- **Message**: "Connection timeout - please check your internet connection"
- **Actions**: Retry, Check connection, Contact support

### Server Unavailable  
- **Message**: "Service temporarily unavailable - we're working to restore it"
- **Actions**: Retry, Check status page, Work offline

### Complete Offline
- **Message**: "You appear to be offline - some features may be limited"
- **Actions**: Reconnect, Work offline, Refresh page

### Slow Connection
- **Message**: "Slow connection detected - some features may take longer to load"
- **Actions**: Continue, Switch to offline mode, Optimize settings

## Error Handling Requirements
- Graceful degradation when network services unavailable
- Data preservation during connection interruptions
