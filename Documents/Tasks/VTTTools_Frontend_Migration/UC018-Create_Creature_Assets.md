# Use Case UC018: Create Creature Assets

## Actor
GM (Game Master)

## Goal
Create creature assets to populate encounters with monsters and adversaries for tactical combat and storytelling

## Preconditions
- GM is authenticated with asset creation permissions
- Asset management service is available
- GM has access to creature images or monster artwork

## Main Flow
1. GM navigates to asset creation page and selects creature asset type
2. System displays creature asset creation form with monster-specific fields
3. GM enters creature information (name, type, challenge rating, stats)
4. GM uploads creature image or selects from monster library
5. GM configures creature combat properties and special abilities
6. GM sets creature behavior and AI parameters
7. GM reviews creature asset configuration
8. GM saves new creature asset to library
9. Creature asset becomes available for encounter placement

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Creature Template Usage:**
1. GM selects from pre-defined creature templates
2. System loads template with default creature properties
3. GM customizes template values as needed
4. GM saves customized creature based on template

**A2 - Advanced Creature Configuration:**
1. GM accesses advanced creature settings
2. System displays detailed combat mechanics and special rules
3. GM configures complex creature abilities and behaviors
4. System validates advanced configuration for game balance

**A3 - Creature Scaling:**
1. GM needs creature variants at different power levels
2. System provides scaling tools for stats and abilities
3. GM creates multiple scaled versions of base creature
4. System generates appropriate variants with balanced stats

## Postconditions
- Creature asset is successfully created and stored
- Creature is available in asset library for encounter design
- Creature combat properties are properly configured
- Asset appears in creature category with appropriate challenge rating

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Asset creation forms for each type (Character, Creature, NPC, Object)
- [ ] Asset editing interface with property updates
- [ ] Asset deletion with confirmation and dependency checking
- [ ] Asset categorization and organization interface
- [ ] Asset library browsing with search and filtering
- [ ] Asset image upload with 10MB limit validation
- [ ] File upload integration with drag-drop support

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Create creature-specific form components with combat stat fields
- Implement creature template system for common monster types
- Use React Hook Form with creature validation and challenge rating calculations
- Add creature scaling tools for level-appropriate encounters
- Create creature ability management with special rules configuration
- Implement creature AI behavior configuration interface
- Add creature stat block generation and preview
- Use creature image cropping optimized for battle map tokens
- Integrate with creature database APIs for official monster stats
- Add encounter balance calculation based on creature challenge ratings
