# UC040: Bulk Content Operations

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC040  
**Use Case Name**: Bulk Content Operations  
**User Story**: As a GM, I want to select multiple content items for bulk operations so that I can efficiently delete, move, or organize large amounts of content  
**Primary Actor**: Game Master (GM)  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Content Organization  
**Level**: User Task  

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated as a GM
- User has multiple content items to manage (adventures, assets, scenes)
- User has appropriate permissions for bulk operations on selected content

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Content Selection**: GM navigates to content library and selects multiple items
2. **Multi-Select Interface**: System provides multi-select controls with selection indicators
3. **Operation Choice**: GM selects desired bulk operation from available options
4. **Operation Preview**: System shows preview of operation effects and confirmation details
5. **Confirmation**: GM confirms bulk operation after reviewing scope and consequences
6. **Progress Tracking**: System executes operation with real-time progress feedback
7. **Result Summary**: System provides summary of completed operations and any issues
8. **State Update**: Content library refreshes to reflect bulk operation results

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Select All/Filter-Based Selection
- 2a1. GM uses "Select All" or applies filters to define selection criteria
- 2a2. System selects all visible content matching current filters
- 2a3. GM can review and modify selection by deselecting specific items
- 2a4. System updates selection count and operation preview
- 2a5. Continue from step 3

### 4a. Operation Customization
- 4a1. GM chooses bulk operation requiring additional configuration
- 4a2. System displays customization interface for the selected operation
- 4a3. GM configures operation parameters (target folder, tags, etc.)
- 4a4. System validates configuration and updates operation preview
- 4a5. Continue from step 5

### 6a. Partial Operation Failure
- 6a1. Some items fail during bulk operation due to permissions or conflicts
- 6a2. System continues processing remaining items while logging failures
- 6a3. System provides option to retry failed items or skip them
- 6a4. GM chooses how to handle failures (retry, skip, abort remaining)
- 6a5. Continue processing based on GM's choice

### 7a. Undo Bulk Operation
- 7a1. GM realizes bulk operation was incorrect and wants to undo
- 7a2. System provides undo option for recent bulk operations
- 7a3. GM confirms undo request with understanding of what will be reversed
- 7a4. System reverses bulk operation where possible and reports results
- 7a5. Content library returns to pre-operation state

## Postconditions
**Success**: Bulk operation completed successfully, content library organized as intended
**Partial Success**: Most items processed successfully, failures clearly communicated
**Failure**: Operation cancelled or failed, content remains unchanged, user informed of issues

## Business Rules
- Maximum bulk operation size: 100 items per operation for performance
- Operations require confirmation when affecting 10 or more items
- Destructive operations (delete) require additional confirmation
- Bulk operations respect individual item permissions and ownership
- Operation history maintained for undo and audit purposes
- Concurrent bulk operations limited to prevent system overload

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **BulkSelector**: Multi-select interface with selection indicators
- **SelectionSummary**: Display showing selected item count and types
- **BulkOperationMenu**: Menu of available operations for selected content
- **OperationPreview**: Component showing operation effects before execution
- **ProgressTracker**: Real-time progress display for bulk operations
- **ResultSummary**: Summary component showing operation results and failures
- **UndoInterface**: Component for reversing recent bulk operations
- **ConfirmationDialog**: Specialized confirmation for destructive operations

### API Integration Points
- **POST** `/api/content/bulk-select` - Validate and process content selection
- **POST** `/api/content/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple content items
- **POST** `/api/content/bulk-move` - Move content items to different folders
- **POST** `/api/content/bulk-tag` - Apply tags to multiple items
- **POST** `/api/content/bulk-organize` - Apply organizational changes
- **POST** `/api/content/bulk-undo` - Reverse recent bulk operation
- **GET** `/api/content/bulk-preview` - Preview bulk operation effects

### State Management
- Multi-select state with item tracking and validation
- Bulk operation progress state with real-time updates
- Operation history state for undo functionality
- Confirmation state for destructive operations
- Error tracking state for partial operation failures

### Bulk Operation Types
- **Delete**: Permanent removal with confirmation and dependency checking
- **Move**: Transfer to different folders with conflict resolution
- **Tag**: Apply or remove tags from multiple items
- **Categorize**: Change categories or types in bulk
- **Share**: Modify sharing permissions for multiple items
- **Export**: Generate exports for selected content collections

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bulk operations provide clear preview of what will be changed
- [ ] Progress tracker updates at minimum every 2 seconds during operations
- [ ] Operation confirmation dialogs clearly explain consequences
- [ ] Bulk delete operations complete within 30 seconds for 50 items

## Bulk Operation Confirmation Requirements

### Low-Risk Operations (Move, Tag, Categorize)
