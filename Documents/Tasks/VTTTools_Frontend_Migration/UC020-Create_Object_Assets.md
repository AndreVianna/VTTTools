# Use Case UC020: Create Object Assets

## Actor
GM (Game Master)

## Goal
Create object assets to add environmental elements, items, and interactive objects to scenes for immersive gameplay

## Preconditions
- GM is authenticated with asset creation permissions
- Asset management service is available
- GM has access to object images or environmental artwork

## Main Flow
1. GM navigates to asset creation page and selects object asset type
2. System displays object asset creation form with environment-focused fields
3. GM enters object information (name, type, description, properties)
4. GM uploads object image or selects from environmental library
5. GM configures object interaction properties and mechanics
6. GM sets object physics properties for scene builder
7. GM reviews object asset configuration
8. GM saves new object asset to library
9. Object asset becomes available for environmental scene design

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Interactive Object Configuration:**
1. GM creates object with special interaction mechanics
2. System provides interaction scripting interface
3. GM defines triggers, actions, and responses for object
4. System validates interaction logic and saves configuration

**A2 - Object Scaling and Variants:**
1. GM needs object in multiple sizes or conditions
2. System provides scaling tools and variant creation
3. GM creates different versions (damaged, upgraded, scaled)
4. System maintains object family relationships

**A3 - Animated Object Properties:**
1. GM creates object with animation or movement properties
2. System provides animation configuration interface
3. GM defines movement patterns, triggers, and visual effects
4. System stores animation data for scene builder use

## Postconditions
- Object asset is successfully created and stored
- Object is available in asset library for scene decoration
- Object interaction and physics properties are configured
- Asset appears in object category with appropriate type classification

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Asset creation forms for each type (Character, Creature, NPC, Object)
- [ ] Asset editing interface with property updates
- [ ] Asset deletion with confirmation and dependency checking
- [ ] Asset categorization and organization interface
- [ ] Asset library browsing with search and filtering
- [ ] Asset image upload with 10MB limit validation
- [ ] File upload integration with drag-drop support

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Create object-specific form components for environmental elements
- Implement object category system (furniture, doors, traps, treasure, etc.)
- Use React Hook Form with object validation and physics property handling
- Add object interaction scripting with visual editor interface
- Create object scaling and transformation tools
- Implement object animation configuration with keyframe support
- Add object layering and z-index management for scene composition
- Use object image optimization for various scene builder zoom levels
- Create object collision detection configuration for gameplay mechanics
- Add object lighting and shadow properties for atmospheric scene design
