# UC038: Search and Filter Assets

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC038  
**Use Case Name**: Search and Filter Assets  
**User Story**: As a GM, I want to search and filter my assets in the UI so that I can efficiently locate specific creatures, characters, or objects  
**Primary Actor**: Game Master (GM)  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Content Organization  
**Level**: User Task  

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated as a GM
- User has access to asset library interface
- Assets exist in the user's library

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Asset Library Access**: GM navigates to asset library or Scene Builder asset browser
2. **Search Query Entry**: GM enters search terms targeting asset names, descriptions, or tags
3. **Filter Application**: GM applies asset-specific filters (type, category, size, etc.)
4. **Visual Search**: System displays filtered results with thumbnail previews
5. **Asset Preview**: GM previews assets without leaving search context
6. **Asset Selection**: GM selects desired asset for use in scenes or editing
7. **Quick Integration**: Selected asset immediately available for Scene Builder or editing
8. **Context Preservation**: Search state preserved for continued asset browsing

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Visual Search by Similarity
- 2a1. GM uploads or selects reference image for visual similarity search
- 2a2. System analyzes image characteristics and finds visually similar assets
- 2a3. System displays results ranked by visual similarity
- 2a4. GM can combine visual search with text and filter criteria
- 2a5. Continue from step 5

### 3a. Category-Based Browsing
- 3a1. GM browses assets by expanding category tree structure
- 3a2. System displays assets within selected categories with counts
- 3a3. GM can select multiple categories for combined browsing
- 3a4. System provides breadcrumb navigation for category hierarchy
- 3a5. Continue from step 4

### 4a. Scene Builder Integration
- 4a1. GM accesses asset search directly from Scene Builder interface
- 4a2. System applies context-appropriate filters (suitable for current scene)
- 4a3. Search results include drag-and-drop functionality for direct placement
- 4a4. GM can preview how assets will look in current scene context
- 4a5. Continue from step 6

### 7a. Batch Asset Selection
- 7a1. GM selects multiple assets from search results for batch operations
- 7a2. System provides batch actions (add to scene, organize, delete)
- 7a3. GM applies batch operations to selected assets
- 7a4. System processes batch operations with progress feedback
- 7a5. GM continues searching or using assets

## Postconditions
**Success**: GM efficiently locates and uses desired assets in their workflow
**Failure**: GM understands search limitations and has alternative approaches

## Business Rules
- Asset search includes names, descriptions, tags, and metadata
- Search results respect asset sharing permissions and ownership
- Recently used assets prioritized in search relevance
- Asset thumbnails generated automatically for visual search
- Search performance optimized for libraries with 1000+ assets
- Integration with Scene Builder maintains search context

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **AssetSearchInterface**: Main search component with asset-specific features
- **AssetTypeFilter**: Filter panel for asset types (Character, Creature, Object, NPC)
- **CategoryBrowser**: Tree-view component for category-based navigation
- **AssetGrid**: Grid display with thumbnails and quick actions
- **AssetPreview**: Modal or sidebar preview with detailed asset information
- **SizeFilter**: Component for filtering by asset dimensions or file size
- **TagCloud**: Visual tag interface for tag-based filtering
- **SceneBuilderIntegration**: Specialized search interface for Scene Builder context

### API Integration Points
- **GET** `/api/assets/search` - Search assets with comprehensive query parameters
- **GET** `/api/assets/categories` - Retrieve asset category structure
- **GET** `/api/assets/tags` - Get available tags with usage frequency
- **POST** `/api/assets/visual-search` - Upload image for similarity search
- **GET** `/api/assets/suggestions` - Get asset suggestions based on context

### State Management
- Asset search state with query history and filters
- Category navigation state with expanded/collapsed sections
- Asset selection state for batch operations
- Preview state with asset details and actions
- Scene Builder integration state with context-aware filtering

### Asset-Specific Search Features
- Type-based filtering (Character, Creature, NPC, Object)
- Size and dimension filtering for scene layout planning
- Color-based search and filtering
- Animation status filtering (static vs animated assets)
- Quality rating and usage frequency sorting

## Acceptance Criteria
