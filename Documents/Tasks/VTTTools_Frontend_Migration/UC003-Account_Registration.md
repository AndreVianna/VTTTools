# Use Case UC003: Account Registration

## Actor
User (potential new user)

## Goal
Create a new account to gain access to the VTT platform and begin using its features

## Preconditions
- User is not currently registered on the platform
- User has access to a valid email address
- Registration service is available

## Main Flow
1. User accesses the registration form from landing page or navigation
2. User enters email address with real-time format validation
3. User enters password with strength requirements displayed
4. User confirms password with matching validation
5. User provides additional required profile information
6. System validates all form fields in real-time
7. User submits registration form
8. System creates account and sends confirmation email
9. User receives and clicks email confirmation link
10. System activates account within 5 seconds
11. User is redirected to login or automatically authenticated

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Email Already Exists:**
1. System detects email is already registered
2. System displays specific error message about existing email
3. System provides link to login or password reset options
4. User can modify email or proceed to login

**A2 - Weak Password:**
1. System detects password doesn't meet requirements
2. System displays specific password requirement violations
3. System provides clear guidance on password improvement
4. User modifies password until requirements are met

**A3 - Email Delivery Failure:**
1. System fails to deliver confirmation email within 10 seconds
2. System displays notification about email delivery issue
3. System provides retry option to resend confirmation email
4. User can retry or contact support for assistance

**A4 - Network Failure:**
1. Registration submission fails due to network issues
2. System displays network error with retry option
3. System preserves form data to prevent data loss
4. User can retry submission when connection is restored

## Postconditions
- User has a valid, activated account on the platform
- User can login and access authenticated features
- User profile information is stored in the system
- User receives welcome communication and guidance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Registration form validates email format in real-time with 200ms debounce
- [ ] Password requirements display clearly with real-time validation feedback
- [ ] Email confirmation sent within 10 seconds with retry option if delivery fails
- [ ] Account activation completes within 5 seconds of valid confirmation link click
- [ ] Registration errors display specific messages (email exists, weak password, network failure)

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Use React Hook Form for efficient form management and validation
- Implement debounced email validation using useDebounce hook
- Use zod or yup for schema validation with TypeScript support
- Implement real-time password strength indicator component
- Integrate with ASP.NET Core Identity registration endpoints
- Use React Query mutations for registration API calls
- Implement proper error boundary for registration failures
- Use controlled components for all form inputs with proper state management
- Implement loading states during form submission and email sending
- Use Bootstrap 5 form components for consistent styling
- Implement proper accessibility attributes for form elements
- Add analytics tracking for registration funnel analysis
