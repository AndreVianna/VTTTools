# Use Case UC005: User Logout

## Actor
User (authenticated user)

## Goal
Securely terminate the current session to protect account security and prevent unauthorized access

## Preconditions
- User is currently authenticated with an active session
- User has access to logout functionality in the application interface

## Main Flow
1. User clicks logout button/link in application navigation
2. System displays confirmation dialog if user has unsaved work or active sessions
3. User confirms logout intention
4. System clears all authentication tokens and session data
5. System terminates SignalR connections and real-time features
6. System redirects user to login page or landing page within 2 seconds
7. System prevents access to protected routes and displays authentication prompts

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Session Timeout:**
1. System detects session has expired automatically
2. System displays timeout notification to user
3. System clears authentication tokens and redirects to login
4. System preserves any unsaved work data for recovery if possible

**A2 - Confirmation Dialog (Active Work):**
1. System detects user has unsaved changes or active work
2. System displays confirmation dialog with work status information
3. User can choose to save work first or proceed with logout
4. System processes user choice and completes logout accordingly

**A3 - Network Issues During Logout:**
1. Logout request fails due to network connectivity
2. System clears local tokens regardless of server response
3. System completes local logout and shows offline status
4. System attempts server-side logout when connectivity is restored

**A4 - Forced Logout (Security):**
1. System detects security issue requiring immediate logout
2. System bypasses confirmation dialogs for immediate security
3. System clears all session data and displays security message
4. User must re-authenticate to continue using the application

## Postconditions
- User session is completely terminated
- All authentication tokens are cleared from client and server
- User cannot access protected routes without re-authentication
- Application state is reset to unauthenticated condition
- Real-time connections are properly closed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Logout clears all authentication tokens and redirects within 2 seconds
- [ ] Logout works both from UI button and session timeout scenarios
- [ ] Confirmation prompt prevents accidental logout during active work sessions
- [ ] Post-logout state prevents access to protected routes and shows login prompt

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Use React Context or Redux actions for logout state management
- Implement confirmation dialog using React Modal or similar component
- Clear all authentication tokens from localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies
- Reset all application state to initial unauthenticated values
- Properly disconnect SignalR connections before logout completion
- Use React Router for protected route redirection post-logout
- Implement automatic session timeout detection with countdown warnings
- Clear any cached API data using React Query cache invalidation
- Implement proper cleanup of all subscriptions and event listeners
- Use proper loading states during logout process
- Implement analytics tracking for logout patterns and user behavior
- Ensure logout works consistently across all browser tabs/windows
