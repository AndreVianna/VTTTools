## Goal
Modify and update existing adventure details and configuration to reflect campaign changes and improvements

## Preconditions

5. GM modifies desired adventure fields and settings
6. System validates changes in real-time
7. GM saves updated adventure information
8. System updates adventure and displays confirmation
9. Changes are reflected in adventure details and throughout system

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Concurrent Editing:**
1. Another user is editing the same adventure
2. System detects concurrent editing conflict
3. System displays conflict resolution options
4. GM chooses to overwrite, merge, or cancel changes

**A2 - Validation Errors:**
1. System detects invalid updates to adventure data
2. System displays specific validation messages
3. System prevents saving until errors are resolved
4. GM corrects issues and resubmits changes

**A3 - Unsaved Changes:**

2. System detects unsaved modifications
3. System prompts to save, discard, or continue editing
4. GM makes decision and system processes accordingly

## Postconditions
- Adventure information is successfully updated
- Changes are persisted and reflected across the system
- Adventure history maintains change tracking
- Other users see updated adventure information

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Adventure creation forms with validation
- [ ] Adventure editing interface with all field updates
- [ ] Adventure cloning functionality with deep-clone support
- [ ] Adventure deletion with confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Adventure visibility controls (public/private, published/draft)
- [ ] Adventure list page with card/list views and filtering
- [ ] Adventure type selection and image management

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Use React Hook Form for adventure editing with pre-populated values
- Implement optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Use React Query for adventure data caching and synchronization
- Implement real-time validation and conflict detection
- Add auto-save functionality for work preservation
- Create reusable adventure editing components
- Use proper loading states during save operations
- Implement change tracking for audit and history
- Add confirmation dialogs for significant changes
- Use React Context for edit mode state management
