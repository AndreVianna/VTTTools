# UC042 - Search Help Documentation

## Use Case Information
- **Use Case ID**: UC042
- **Use Case Name**: Search Help Documentation
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to search help documentation within the app so that I can find answers to specific questions quickly

## Main Flow
1. **User initiates help search** through global search, help menu, or keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+/)
2. **System displays search interface** with search input and filtering options
3. **User enters search query** (text, keywords, or phrases)
4. **System performs real-time search** as user types (debounced)
5. **System displays search results** with relevance ranking and content highlighting
6. **User reviews search results** with title, snippet, and relevance score
7. **User selects result** to view full help content
8. **System displays detailed help** in appropriate format (modal, sidebar, or dedicated page)
9. **User applies information** or returns to search for refinement

## Alternative Flows
### A1: No Search Results Found
5a. System displays "No results found" message with search suggestions
5b. System offers alternative search terms or broader categories
5c. User can refine search or access general help categories

### A2: Too Many Results
5a. System displays pagination or "Show more results" functionality
5b. User can apply filters (category, feature area, content type)
5c. System refines results based on filters

### A3: Search Suggestion Selection
3a. System provides search suggestions/autocomplete as user types
3b. User selects suggestion from dropdown
3c. Search executes with selected suggestion

### A4: Advanced Search
2a. User accesses advanced search options
2b. User specifies search criteria (category, tags, content type)
2c. System performs filtered search with specified criteria

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Search Architecture
```typescript
interface HelpSearchState {
  query: string;
  results: SearchResult[];
  loading: boolean;
  filters: SearchFilters;
  history: string[];
}

interface SearchResult {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  snippet: string;
  category: string;
  relevanceScore: number;
  highlights: string[];
  url: string;
}

interface SearchFilters {
  category?: HelpCategory;
  tags?: string[];
  contentType?: 'tutorial' | 'reference' | 'faq' | 'troubleshooting';
}
```

### Search Implementation
- **Search Engine**: Lightweight client-side search using libraries like Fuse.js or MiniSearch
- **Indexing Strategy**: Pre-built search index with content chunking for relevant snippets
- **Real-time Search**: Debounced search (300ms) with cancel-previous-request logic
- **Result Ranking**: TF-IDF based relevance scoring with boost factors for different content types

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Search index loaded on first help access
- **Caching**: Search results cached for repeat queries
- **Throttling**: Request throttling to prevent search API overload
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic search works offline, enhanced features require connection
