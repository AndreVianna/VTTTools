# UC033: Form Validation Error Display

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC033  
**Use Case Name**: Form Validation Error Display  
**User Story**: As a user, I want to see specific validation errors on forms so that I can correct my input and successfully submit forms  
**Primary Actor**: Any User  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Error Handling  
**Level**: System Feature  

## Preconditions
- User is interacting with any form in the application
- Form contains validation rules and requirements

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Form Interaction**: User begins filling out a form with validation requirements
2. **Real-time Validation**: System validates field input as user types or leaves each field
3. **Error Detection**: System detects validation rule violations
4. **Error Display**: System shows specific, field-level error messages immediately
5. **Guidance Provision**: System provides clear guidance on how to correct the error
6. **Error Resolution**: User corrects input based on provided guidance
7. **Success Confirmation**: System confirms valid input and removes error messages
8. **Form Submission**: User successfully submits form with all validation passed

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Debounced Validation
- 2a1. System waits for brief pause in user typing before validating
- 2a2. Validation occurs after 300ms of inactivity to avoid constant error flashing
- 2a3. System provides immediate feedback once validation completes
- 2a4. Continue from step 3

### 4a. Multiple Field Errors
- 4a1. System detects validation errors in multiple form fields
- 4a2. System displays all relevant error messages simultaneously
- 4a3. System provides error summary at form level if appropriate
- 4a4. System prioritizes critical errors for user attention
- 4a5. Continue from step 5

### 6a. Progressive Error Resolution
- 6a1. User corrects one field while others still have errors
- 6a2. System immediately removes error for corrected field
- 6a3. System maintains errors for remaining invalid fields
- 6a4. System updates form submission state based on overall validation status
- 6a5. Continue monitoring remaining fields

### 8a. Server-side Validation Errors
- 8a1. Form passes client-side validation but fails server validation
- 8a2. System receives server validation response with specific errors
- 8a3. System maps server errors to appropriate form fields
- 8a4. System displays server validation errors using same UI patterns
- 8a5. User corrects issues and resubmits form

## Postconditions
**Success**: Form submitted successfully with all validation requirements met
**Failure**: User understands validation requirements and knows how to proceed

## Business Rules
- Error messages must be specific to the validation rule that failed
- Errors should appear as close as possible to the relevant form field
- Error messages must provide actionable guidance for resolution
- Multiple errors on the same field should be prioritized by severity
- Form submission disabled until all validation errors resolved
- Error messages should be consistent in tone and formatting across the application

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **ValidationErrorDisplay**: Component for showing field-specific error messages
- **FieldValidator**: Higher-order component for form field validation
- **ErrorSummary**: Component for displaying form-level error summary
- **ValidationIndicator**: Visual indicator showing field validation state
- **HelpText**: Component for displaying helpful validation guidance
- **FormErrorBoundary**: Error boundary for handling form validation failures
- **ProgressiveValidation**: Component managing step-by-step validation workflows

### API Integration Points
- **POST** `/api/forms/validate` - Server-side validation for complex rules
- **GET** `/api/validation/rules/{formType}` - Retrieve validation rules for form types
- **POST** `/api/forms/submit` - Form submission with server-side validation

### State Management
- Field validation state with individual error tracking
- Form-level validation state and submission readiness
- Real-time validation results with error message mapping
- User interaction state to control validation timing
- Server validation response integration with client-side state

### Validation Features
- Client-side validation with immediate feedback
- Server-side validation integration for complex business rules
- Custom validation rules with configurable error messages
- Conditional validation based on other field values
- File upload validation with specific error handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Field validation occurs within 300ms of user input completion
- [ ] Error messages appear immediately adjacent to relevant form fields
- [ ] Error messages use clear, non-technical language
- [ ] Multiple validation errors on single field display in priority order
- [ ] Valid fields show positive confirmation (green check, etc.)
- [ ] Form submission button disabled when validation errors present
- [ ] Error messages include specific guidance for correction
- [ ] Real-time validation doesn't interfere with user typing experience
- [ ] Server validation errors integrate seamlessly with client-side validation UI
- [ ] Error message styling consistent across all form types
- [ ] Validation state persists during page navigation within forms

## Error Types and Validation Rules

### Required Field Validation
- **Error**: "This field is required"
- **Guidance**: Clear indication of mandatory fields with visual markers

### Format Validation (Email, Phone, etc.)
- **Error**: "Please enter a valid email address"
- **Guidance**: Show expected format example

### Length Validation
- **Error**: "Password must be at least 8 characters"
- **Guidance**: Show current character count and requirements

### Pattern Validation
- **Error**: "Username can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores"
- **Guidance**: Provide examples of valid usernames

### Custom Business Rule Validation
- **Error**: "Adventure name already exists in your library"
- **Guidance**: Suggest alternative names or provide link to existing adventure

## Error Handling Requirements
- Graceful handling of validation service failures
- Fallback validation for offline scenarios
- Clear error messaging when validation rules cannot be loaded
- Recovery mechanisms for form state corruption
- Protection against infinite validation loops

## Performance Requirements
- Field validation completes within 200ms for simple rules
- Complex validation (server calls) completes within 2 seconds
- Error message display updates within 100ms of validation completion
- Form remains responsive during validation processing
- Batch validation for multiple fields completes within 1 second

## Security Considerations  
- Client-side validation supplemented by server-side validation
- Input sanitization during validation process
- Protection against validation bypass attempts
- Secure transmission of validation data to server
- Rate limiting for validation requests to prevent abuse

## Accessibility Requirements
- Screen reader announcements for validation errors
- ARIA labels associating errors with form fields
- High contrast error message display
- Keyboard navigation support for error correction workflow
- Focus management directing attention to first error field
- Error messages readable by assistive technologies

## User Experience Requirements
- Non-intrusive validation that doesn't frustrate users
- Progressive disclosure of validation requirements
- Helpful suggestions for common validation failures
- Visual consistency across all form validation scenarios
- Clear distinction between different types of validation feedback
- Smooth transitions for error appearance and disappearance

## Integration Requirements
- Asset upload forms with file validation
- Adventure creation forms with business rule validation
- User registration and profile forms with security validation
- Session scheduling forms with date/time validation
- Scene Builder forms with configuration validation
- Integration with form libraries (React Hook Form, Formik, etc.)

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all validation rules and error message generation
- Integration tests for client-server validation coordination
- Accessibility tests for screen reader error announcement
- Performance tests for validation response times
- User experience tests for validation workflow efficiency
