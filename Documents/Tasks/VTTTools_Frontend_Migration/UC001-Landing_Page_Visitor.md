# Use Case UC001: Landing Page Visitor

## Actor
Visitor (unauthenticated user)

## Goal
Understand the VTT platform's purpose and receive guidance to register or login to access the application

## Preconditions
- User is not authenticated
- User is accessing the application for the first time
- Platform services are available

## Main Flow
1. User navigates to the VTTTools application URL
2. System loads the landing page with hero section, feature overview, and navigation elements
3. System displays key VTT platform information and capabilities
4. System presents clear Register and Login call-to-action buttons
5. User reviews the platform information and understands the application's purpose
6. User selects either Register or Login to proceed with platform access

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Platform Services Unavailable:**
1. System detects backend services are unavailable
2. System displays error state with service status information
3. System provides retry mechanism for user to refresh the page
4. User can retry access or return later when services are restored

**A2 - Slow Network Connection:**
1. System displays loading states for content that takes longer than expected
2. System progressively loads content to maintain user engagement
3. System provides feedback about loading progress

## Postconditions
- User understands the VTT platform's purpose and capabilities
- User has clear access paths to registration or login flows
- User can proceed to authentication based on their needs

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Landing page loads completely within 2 seconds on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Landing page displays all key elements (hero section, feature overview, CTA buttons) within 1 second
- [ ] Clear call-to-action buttons for Register and Login with hover states and 44px minimum click targets
- [ ] Landing page renders without layout shifts (CLS score < 0.1) and maintains consistent visual hierarchy
- [ ] Error state displays when platform services unavailable with retry mechanism and status information

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Implement as functional component using React 18+ with TypeScript
- Use React Suspense for progressive loading of content sections
- Implement error boundary for service unavailability scenarios
- Use Bootstrap 5 design system for consistent styling
- Optimize bundle loading for fastest initial page render
- Implement performance monitoring to track Core Web Vitals
- Use semantic HTML structure for accessibility compliance
- Implement proper error states with user-friendly messaging
