# Use Case UC011: Change Password

## Actor
User (authenticated user)

## Goal
Update account password to maintain account security and comply with security best practices

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated and logged into their account
- User knows their current password
- Password change service is available

## Main Flow
1. User navigates to password change section in account settings
2. System displays password change form
3. User enters current password for verification
4. User enters new password with strength requirements displayed
5. User confirms new password by entering it again
6. System validates current password and new password requirements
7. User submits password change request
8. System updates password and invalidates other sessions
9. System displays confirmation and security notification

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - Incorrect Current Password:**
1. System determines current password is incorrect
2. System displays error message for current password field
3. System suggests password reset option if multiple failures
4. User can retry with correct password or use password reset

**A2 - Weak New Password:**
1. System detects new password doesn't meet security requirements
2. System displays specific password strength feedback
3. System provides real-time strength indicator
4. User modifies password until requirements are met

**A3 - Password Confirmation Mismatch:**
1. New password and confirmation don't match
2. System displays mismatch error in real-time
3. User corrects confirmation field
4. System validates match before allowing submission

## Postconditions
- User password is successfully updated
- Previous password is invalidated
- Other active sessions are terminated for security
- User receives security notification about password change

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Profile information update forms with validation
- [ ] Account settings interface for preferences
- [ ] Password change functionality with current password verification

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Use React Hook Form for password change form with validation
- Implement real-time password strength indicator component
- Use secure password input fields with show/hide functionality
- Integrate with VttTools.Auth microservice password change endpoints
- Implement proper current password verification
- Add loading states during password change process
- Use password strength validation library (zxcvbn or similar)
- Implement session invalidation after password change
- Add proper error handling and user feedback
- Use security best practices for password handling in React
