# Use Case UC007: Two-Factor Authentication

## Actor
User (authenticated user seeking enhanced security)

## Goal
Set up and use two-factor authentication to enhance account security beyond password-only authentication

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated with valid account
- User has access to mobile device or authenticator app
- 2FA service is available and configured

## Main Flow
1. User accesses 2FA setup from account settings
2. System displays 2FA setup options (authenticator app, SMS)
3. User selects authenticator app option
4. System generates QR code for authenticator app setup
5. User scans QR code with authenticator app
6. System requests verification code to confirm setup
7. User enters verification code from authenticator app
8. System validates code and enables 2FA for account
9. System displays recovery codes for backup access
10. User saves recovery codes in secure location

## Alternative Flows
**A1 - 2FA Login Process:**
1. User completes standard login with username/password
2. System detects 2FA is enabled and requests second factor
3. User opens authenticator app and gets current code
4. User enters 2FA code in verification form
5. System validates code and grants full authentication

**A2 - Recovery Code Usage:**
1. User cannot access authenticator app during login
2. User selects "Use recovery code" option
3. User enters one of the saved recovery codes
4. System validates recovery code and grants access
5. System marks recovery code as used

**A3 - 2FA Disable Process:**
1. User accesses 2FA settings to disable
2. System requires current password and 2FA code verification
3. User provides required authentication factors
4. System disables 2FA and removes associated data

## Postconditions
- 2FA is successfully configured for user account
- User has backup recovery codes for emergency access
- Future logins require both password and 2FA code
- Account security is significantly enhanced

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 2FA setup interface with QR code generation
- [ ] 2FA verification during login process
- [ ] Recovery codes management interface

## Technical Notes
**React Implementation Considerations:**
- Use QR code generation library for authenticator app setup
- Implement secure 2FA token validation with time-based codes
- Integrate with VttTools.Auth microservice 2FA functionality
- Create reusable 2FA verification component for login flow
- Implement recovery code display and management interface
- Use proper security practices for 2FA secret storage
- Add loading states for 2FA verification processes
- Implement proper error handling for invalid codes
- Use modal dialogs for 2FA setup and verification workflows
- Add analytics for 2FA adoption and usage patterns
