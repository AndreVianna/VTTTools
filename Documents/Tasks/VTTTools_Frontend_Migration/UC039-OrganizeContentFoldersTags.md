# UC039: Organize Content into Folders/Tags

## Use Case Overview
**Use Case ID**: UC039  
**Use Case Name**: Organize Content into Folders/Tags  
**User Story**: As a GM, I want to organize content into folders or tags so that I can structure my large content library logically  
**Primary Actor**: Game Master (GM)  
**Scope**: VTTTools React Frontend - Content Organization  
**Level**: User Task  

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated as a GM
- User has content to organize (adventures, assets, scenes)
- User has access to content management interfaces

## Main Success Scenario
1. **Organization Access**: GM navigates to content organization interface
2. **Structure Planning**: GM decides on folder hierarchy or tagging strategy
3. **Folder/Tag Creation**: GM creates folders or tags with descriptive names
4. **Content Selection**: GM selects content items to organize
5. **Organization Assignment**: GM assigns content to folders or applies tags
6. **Hierarchy Management**: GM arranges folders in logical hierarchy if using folder system
7. **Validation**: System validates organization structure and prevents conflicts
8. **Confirmation**: GM reviews and confirms organizational structure

## Alternative Flows

### 2a. Hybrid Organization Strategy
- 2a1. GM chooses to use both folders and tags for comprehensive organization
- 2a2. GM creates folder structure for primary organization
- 2a3. GM creates tags for cross-cutting concerns and attributes
- 2a4. GM applies both folder assignments and tag labels to content
- 2a5. Continue from step 6

### 4a. Drag-and-Drop Organization
- 4a1. GM uses drag-and-drop interface to move content between folders
- 4a2. System provides visual feedback during drag operations
- 4a3. GM drops content onto target folders or tag areas
- 4a4. System automatically updates content organization
- 4a5. Continue from step 7

### 5a. Bulk Organization Operations
- 5a1. GM selects multiple content items for batch organization
- 5a2. GM applies folder assignments or tags to all selected items
- 5a3. System processes bulk organization with progress feedback
- 5a4. GM can review and adjust bulk assignments before confirming
- 5a5. Continue from step 7

### 6a. Smart Organization Suggestions
- 6a1. System analyzes content metadata and usage patterns
- 6a2. System suggests logical folder structures or relevant tags
- 6a3. GM reviews suggestions and accepts or modifies them
- 6a4. System applies accepted suggestions automatically
- 6a5. Continue from step 7

## Postconditions
**Success**: Content logically organized using folders and/or tags, easily discoverable
**Failure**: GM understands organization limitations and has alternative approaches

## Business Rules
- Folder hierarchies support up to 5 levels deep for performance
- Content can belong to only one folder but have multiple tags
- Folder and tag names must be unique within user's library
- Organization changes immediately reflected in search and browse interfaces
- Deleted folders move contained content to parent or "Uncategorized"
- Tag usage frequency tracked for suggestion prioritization

## Technical Requirements

### React Components Needed
- **ContentOrganizer**: Main interface for managing folders and tags
- **FolderTree**: Hierarchical tree component for folder management
- **TagManager**: Interface for creating and managing tags
- **DragDropOrganizer**: Drag-and-drop interface for content organization
- **BulkOrganizer**: Component for batch organization operations
- **OrganizationPreview**: Preview component showing organizational structure
- **SmartSuggestions**: Component providing AI-driven organization suggestions
- **ContentBrowser**: Enhanced browser showing organized content structure

### API Integration Points
- **GET** `/api/content/organization` - Retrieve user's organizational structure
- **POST** `/api/content/folders` - Create new folder
