- Ctrl+marquee for additive selection
- Blue selection borders with consistent styling
- Selection persistence across page refresh

**2. Advanced Snap Modes**
- **Alt**: Free movement (no snapping)
- **Ctrl**: Force grid snap
- **Ctrl+Alt**: Half-step snapping (0.5 cell precision)
- Size-aware snapping:
  - Assets ≤0.5 cells → 0.5 cell snapping
  - Assets >0.5 cells → 1 cell snapping
- Independent per-dimension snapping

**3. Collision Detection System**
- Real-time overlap detection during drag
- Red X markers at collision points
- Multiple markers for multi-collision scenarios
- 1px tolerance (edge-touching is OK)
- Prevents invalid placement
- Visual feedback during drag operations

**4. Multi-Asset Group Operations**
- Drag multiple selected assets together
- Maintains relative positions during group drag
- Group snapping with collision validation
- Batch undo/redo for group operations
- Consistent behavior across all operations

**5. Enhanced Undo/Redo Architecture**
- Batch commands for multi-asset operations
- Snapshot-based commands (Memento pattern)
- Fixed consecutive move tracking
- Proper oldPosition capture for all operations
- PlacedAssetSnapshot interface for future features
- Utility functions:
  - `createUpdateAssetCommand`
  - `createTransformAssetCommand`

**6. Layout Architecture Separation**
- Created EditorLayout (compact, no footer, 100vh)
- Separated from AppLayout (standard pages)
- NetworkStatus query-conditional (?checkNetwork)
- Reorganized Scene Editor menu bar
- Proper layout hierarchy for different page types

- **Comments**: Removed 35+ unnecessary comments per CLAUDE.md policy

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Initial Implementation** (2025-10-11): 47 critical issues identified
2. **Decision Point**: REIMPLEMENT (28h) chosen over FIX (40-50h)
3. **Reimplementation** (2025-10-19): 8-step plan executed
4. **Enhancements** (2025-10-20 to 2025-10-23): Major features added
5. **Final Review**: 5/5 stars, GO FOR PRODUCTION

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture Improvements
- Clean separation of concerns with React Context
- Proper command pattern implementation
- Memento pattern for complex operations
- Layout system architecture established

### User Experience Enhancements
- Intuitive multi-selection with industry-standard shortcuts
- Visual feedback for all operations
- Collision prevention improves usability
- Advanced snap modes for precision placement

### Developer Experience
- Well-structured, maintainable code
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear interfaces and type definitions
- Reusable utility functions

## Known Limitations

1. **Performance**: 100-token @ 60fps optimization deferred to Phase 12
2. **Persistence**: Scene changes not yet saved to backend (Phase 7)
3. **Collaboration**: No real-time sync yet (Phase 10)

## Integration Points for Phase 7

Phase 7 (Scene Management) can leverage:
- PlacedAssetSnapshot interface for scene serialization
- Undo/redo system for scene operations
- Layout architecture for scene list pages
- Selection system for scene thumbnail generation

## Recommendations for Phase 7

1. **Scene Persistence**: Use PlacedAssetSnapshot format for backend storage
2. **Scene Thumbnails**: Leverage selection system for preview generation
3. **Scene Templates**: Build on collision detection for valid templates
4. **Batch Operations**: Use batch command pattern for scene operations
