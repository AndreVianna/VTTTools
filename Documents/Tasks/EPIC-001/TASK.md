## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy

**Incremental Feature-by-Feature Migration**:
1. ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (routing, auth context, API integration with RTK Query)
2. ✅ Phase 2: Authentication & Onboarding (login, register, landing page)
3. 🚧 Phase 3: Scene Editor Core (Konva canvas, panning, zoom, grid - IN PROGRESS)
4. 🔜 Phase 4: Asset Library & Content Management
5. 🔜 Phase 5: Game Session & Real-Time Collaboration (SignalR integration)
6. 🔜 Phase 6: Account Management & Settings
7. 🔜 Phase 7: Legacy Cleanup & Optimization

### Key Steps

1. **Setup React Foundation** ✅ COMPLETE
   - Action: Bootstrap React 19 + Vite + TypeScript project
   - Component: WebClientApp/
   - Estimated Time: 4 hours
   - Status: ✅ Done

2. **Configure Redux Toolkit with RTK Query** ✅ COMPLETE
   - Action: Setup store, create API slices for all backend services
   - Component: WebClientApp/src/store/
   - Estimated Time: 8 hours
   - Status: ✅ Done (auth slice, API configuration)

3. **Implement Authentication Pages** ✅ COMPLETE
   - Action: Build login, register, 2FA, password reset pages with Material-UI
   - Component: WebClientApp/src/pages/auth/
   - Estimated Time: 16 hours
   - Status: ✅ Done (LoginPage.tsx, SimpleLoginForm.tsx, SimpleRegistrationForm.tsx)

4. **Build Scene Editor with Konva** 🚧 IN PROGRESS
   - Action: Implement canvas-based scene editor with Stage, Layer, panning, zoom, grid overlay
   - Component: WebClientApp/src/components/scene/
   - Estimated Time: 40 hours
   - Status: 🚧 40% Complete (panning/zoom done, grid and token placement ongoing)

5. **Implement Asset Library UI** 🔜 PLANNED
   - Action: Build asset browsing, filtering, creation, management with Material-UI cards/dialogs
   - Component: WebClientApp/src/pages/assets/
   - Estimated Time: 24 hours
   - Status: Not started

6. **Build Content Management UI** 🔜 PLANNED
   - Action: Epic/Campaign/Adventure/Scene hierarchy management with tree views and forms
   - Component: WebClientApp/src/pages/library/
   - Estimated Time: 32 hours
   - Status: Not started

7. **Integrate SignalR for Real-Time** 🔜 PLANNED

   - Component: Documentation, project references
   - Estimated Time: 4 hours
   - Status: Not started

### Technical Considerations

- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with slices for auth, assets, scenes, sessions; RTK Query for API caching
- **Routing**: React Router 7.9 with protected routes and auth guards
- **API Integration**: Axios + RTK Query with automatic retry, caching, and optimistic updates
- **Real-Time**: SignalR Client 9.0.6 for chat, events, and collaborative editing
- **Canvas Rendering**: Konva 10.0 + React-Konva 19.0 for high-performance scene editor
- **Styling**: Material-UI 7.3 with custom theme matching VTT brand
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for components, Playwright for E2E
- **Build**: Vite 7.1.5 with code splitting and lazy loading
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript 5.9 strict mode with comprehensive type definitions

## Dependencies

### Blocking Tasks

- None - This is a foundational epic

### Blocked Tasks

- All future UI feature enhancements will use React (blocked until migration complete)
- Mobile app development (planned) depends on React architecture patterns

### External Dependencies

- **Material-UI 7.3**: UI component library
- **Konva 10.0**: Canvas rendering engine
- **SignalR Client 9.0.6**: Real-time communication

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- **Coverage Target**: 80% for React components and hooks
- **Key Scenarios**: Component rendering, user interactions, Redux state updates, hook behaviors
- **Components to Test**: All new React components, custom hooks (useAuth, useGameSession, useScene)

### Integration Tests

- **Systems Involved**: WebClientApp (React) ↔ VttTools.WebApp (API Gateway)

### E2E Tests
- **Framework**: Playwright 1.55
- **Scenarios**: Complete user journeys (login → create adventure → edit scene → start session)
- **Coverage Target**: Critical paths (authentication, scene editor, asset library)

### BDD Tests
- **Feature Files to Implement Step Definitions**: 101 feature files (all UI-related use cases)

## Risk Assessment

### Risk: Performance Regression During Migration
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Incremental feature rollout, performance profiling at each phase, A/B testing
- **Contingency**: Rollback to Blazor for specific features if React performance inadequate

### Risk: SignalR Integration Complexity
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Early SignalR client integration testing, dedicated testing phase
- **Contingency**: Implement polling fallback if SignalR client issues arise

### Risk: Konva Learning Curve
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Konva prototyping completed (panning/zoom working), extensive documentation available
- **Contingency**: Fallback to HTML5 Canvas API if Konva limitations discovered

### Risk: State Management Complexity
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Redux Toolkit simplifies state management, RTK Query handles API caching
- **Contingency**: Simplify state structure, use more local component state if Redux overhead excessive

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

- **React Over Blazor**
  - Decision: Migrate to React 19 ecosystem
  - Rationale: Better performance (no .NET runtime in browser), richer ecosystem (Material-UI, Konva, extensive libraries), superior developer experience, better hiring pool
  - Alternatives Considered: Continue with Blazor (rejected - performance concerns, limited canvas tooling)

- **Material-UI Over Custom Components**
  - Decision: Use Material-UI 7.3 for all standard components
  - Rationale: Comprehensive component library, accessibility built-in, theming system, active community
  - Alternatives Considered: Ant Design (rejected - Material-UI more aligned with modern design), Custom components (rejected - development time)

- **Konva for Scene Editor**
  - Decision: Use Konva + React-Konva for canvas rendering
  - Rationale: High-performance canvas library, React integration, event handling, layer management, excellent for tactical maps
  - Alternatives Considered: Fabric.js (rejected - less React support), Pixi.js (rejected - overkill for 2D tactical maps), Raw Canvas API (rejected - too low-level)

- **Redux Toolkit for State Management**
  - Decision: Centralized state with Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
  - Rationale: Predictable state, excellent DevTools, RTK Query eliminates boilerplate, integrates with SignalR
  - Alternatives Considered: Context API only (rejected - insufficient for complex state), Zustand (rejected - Redux ecosystem more mature)

### Code Locations

- **WebClientApp** (Primary SPA): `Source/WebClientApp/`
  - Lines: Full project (~5,000+ lines TypeScript/TSX)
  - Change Type: New implementation (replacing Blazor)

- **VttTools.WebApp.WebAssembly** (Legacy Blazor): `Source/WebApp.WebAssembly/`
  - Lines: Entire project
  - Change Type: Deprecation (mark as legacy, eventual removal)

- **VttTools.WebApp.Common** (Legacy Blazor Components): `Source/WebApp.Common/`
  - Lines: Entire project
  - Change Type: Deprecation (mark as legacy, eventual removal)

### Configuration Changes

- **package.json**
  - Setting: dependencies
  - Added: React 19.1, Material-UI 7.3, Redux Toolkit 2.9, Konva 10.0, SignalR 9.0.6
  - Reason: React ecosystem packages

- **tsconfig.json**
  - Setting: compilerOptions.strict
  - Value: true
  - Reason: Enforce TypeScript type safety

- **vite.config.ts**
  - Setting: Build configuration, path aliases, proxy
  - Value: Path aliases (@components, @pages, etc.), proxy to https://localhost:5001 for API
  - Reason: Development experience, API integration
