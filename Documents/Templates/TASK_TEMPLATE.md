**Test Patterns:**
- [Specific unit test patterns for this task]
- [Mock setup and teardown requirements]
- [Test data management and cleanup approach]
- [Assertion patterns and expected outcomes]

**Mock Examples:**
```typescript
// Example mock setup for this task
const mockApiService = {
  [methodName]: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([expected response]),
  [errorMethod]: jest.fn().mockRejectedValue(new Error('[specific error]'))
};
```

#### [OPTIONAL] BDD Integration Scenarios [IF integration testing needed]
**Include this section if the task involves:**
- Cross-system integration requiring behavior validation
- Complex user workflows spanning multiple components
- Real-time features requiring multi-user scenarios
- File upload/download workflows

**Feature**: [Task functionality described in BDD format]
**Integration Scenarios:**

  As a [user role]
  I want [capability]
  So that [benefit]

Background:
  Given [common preconditions for all scenarios]

Scenario: [Happy path integration]
  Given [specific precondition]
  And [additional context]

  And [system processes action]
  Then [expected outcome]
  And [integration result]

Scenario: [Error handling integration]
  Given [error precondition]
  When [action that triggers error]
  Then [error handling behavior]
  And [system recovery state]

Scenario: [Edge case integration]
  Given [edge case condition]
  When [edge case action]
  Then [edge case handling]
```
