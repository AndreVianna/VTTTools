3. Renumber remaining subsections sequentially (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc.)
4. Update cross-references to maintain consistency

## Feature Type Examples
- **UI Features**: Keep 4.2 Frontend Requirements, remove storage/backend if not needed

3. **Renumber Remaining Sections**: Update section numbers sequentially (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc.)
4. **Update Cross-References**: Fix any internal references to renumbered sections
5. **Adapt Placeholders**: Replace [bracketed placeholders] with domain-specific content

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Vague User Stories**: "As a user, I want the system to work well"
- **Subjective Acceptance Criteria**: "Application should be user-friendly"
- **Mixed Requirements and Implementation**: Combining what to build with how to build it
- **Missing Infrastructure Analysis**: Not documenting existing vs. new requirements
- **Incomplete Error Scenarios**: Only documenting happy path scenarios
- **Over-Specification**: Including optional sections that don't apply to the task
- **Inconsistent Numbering**: Failing to renumber sections after customization
