# Landing Page Feature

**Original Request**: Onboarding area landing page specification from React implementation

**Landing Page** is a presentation feature that provides the primary entry point for users visiting the VTT Tools platform. This feature affects the Onboarding area and enables both authenticated Game Masters/Players to access their dashboard and unauthenticated visitors to learn about the platform and begin their journey.

## Change Log
- *2025-01-15* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from React implementation analysis
- *2025-01-15* — **1.1.0** — All 3 use cases identified and documented

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Seamless experience with contextual presentation based on authentication state
- **Business Objective**: Convert visitors to registered users while providing authenticated users quick dashboard access
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Visitor-to-registration conversion rate >5%
  - Authenticated user click-through to dashboard >90%
  - Page load time <1.5 seconds
  - Mobile responsive design score >95

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Onboarding
- **Secondary Areas**: Identity (depends on authentication state)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: Entry point for all user journeys; consumes Identity authentication state

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: yes
- **Primary UI Type**: FULL_PAGE with conditional rendering
- **UI Complexity**: Medium - dual-mode presentation with styled components
- **Estimated UI Components**: 3 major sections (page container, hero section, dashboard preview)

### Use Case UI Breakdown
- **Render Landing Page**: FULL_PAGE - Route: / (root) with authentication-based conditional rendering
- **Display Hero Section**: WIDGET - Location: LandingPage (non-authenticated view)
- **Display Dashboard Preview**: WIDGET - Location: LandingPage (authenticated view)

### UI Integration Points
- **Navigation Entries**: Root route (/) accessible from all contexts
- **Routes Required**: / (root path)
- **Shared Components**: HeroContainer, DashboardContainer, styled CTAs

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Onboarding**: Primary landing page presentation and user journey initiation
- **Identity**: Consumes authentication state to determine presentation mode

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Render Landing Page** (Onboarding): Orchestrate page rendering with authentication-aware conditional logic
- **Display Hero Section** (Onboarding): Present marketing content and CTAs for non-authenticated visitors
- **Display Dashboard Preview** (Onboarding): Display welcome message and dashboard access for authenticated users

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**:
  - ILandingPagePresenter (conditional rendering orchestration)
  - IAuthenticationContext (consume auth state from Identity area)
- **External Dependencies**:
  - React Router for navigation
  - Material-UI for styled components
  - useAuth hook from Identity context
- **Implementation Priority**: Single phase (all use cases tightly coupled in presentation logic)

---

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Onboarding** → **Identity**: Queries authentication state via useAuth hook (read-only)
- **Onboarding** → **Identity**: Provides navigation to /login, /register routes
- **Onboarding** → **Dashboard**: Provides navigation to /dashboard for authenticated users

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: Read-only access to authentication state (isAuthenticated, user.userName)
- **Interface Contracts**: Consumes IAuthContext interface from Identity area
- **Dependency Management**: Onboarding depends on Identity for auth state; no circular dependencies

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**:
  - UI component fully implemented (React/TypeScript/MUI)
  - Styled components with gradient backgrounds and Material Design patterns
  - Conditional rendering based on isAuthenticated flag
- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Unit tests for conditional rendering logic (authenticated vs non-authenticated)
  - Visual regression tests for hero section styling
  - E2E tests for navigation flows from CTAs
  - BDD scenarios for visitor and authenticated user journeys
- **Architecture Compliance**:
  - React UI component (Presentation layer)
  - Consumes Identity context (cross-area dependency via interface)
  - No business logic (pure presentation)

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Landing Page Presentation (Priority: Critical)
- **Render Landing Page**: Foundation orchestration component with routing integration
- **Display Hero Section**: Marketing presentation for visitor conversion
- **Display Dashboard Preview**: Authenticated user welcome and quick access

**Rationale**: All three use cases are tightly coupled in a single page component with conditional rendering logic. They must be implemented together as they share the same route and component lifecycle.

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**:
  - React Router for navigation ✓ (implemented)
  - Material-UI for styled components ✓ (implemented)
  - useAuth hook from Identity ✓ (implemented)
- **Area Dependencies**: Identity area (authentication state)
- **External Dependencies**: None

This Landing Page feature provides comprehensive guidance for the primary entry point experience within the Onboarding area while maintaining clean architectural boundaries and excellent user experience for both visitors and authenticated users of the VTT Tools platform.
