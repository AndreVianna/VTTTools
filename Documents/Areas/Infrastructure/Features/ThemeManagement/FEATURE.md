# Theme Management Feature

**Original Request**: Extract Platform Infrastructure features from React component implementations

**Theme Management** is a UI infrastructure feature that provides Material-UI theme configuration and context for light and dark display modes. This feature affects the Platform Infrastructure area and enables all users to experience consistent, professionally styled UI components with customizable theme preferences.

---

## Change Log
- *2025-01-02* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from VTTThemeProvider.tsx analysis

---

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Consistent, professional visual design with theme customization for accessibility and preference
- **Business Objective**: Provide unified theming system that ensures brand consistency and supports accessibility requirements
- **Success Criteria**: All UI components styled consistently, theme switching works instantly, brand colors applied globally

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Platform Infrastructure
- **Secondary Areas**: None (cross-cutting infrastructure concern)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: All features render within this theme context, inherit theme styles automatically

---

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: yes (indirectly - provides theme context for all UI)
- **Primary UI Type**: WIDGET (Theme provider wrapper)
- **UI Complexity**: Medium (Material-UI theme configuration, color palette, typography system)
- **Estimated UI Components**: 1 component (VTTThemeProvider)

### Use Case UI Breakdown
- **Provide Theme Context**: WIDGET - Wraps application with Material-UI ThemeProvider (infrastructure wrapper)
- **Configure Light Theme**: WIDGET - Defines light mode color palette, typography, and component styles
- **Configure Dark Theme**: WIDGET - Defines dark mode color palette, typography, and component styles

### UI Integration Points
- **Navigation Entries**: None (theme provider is invisible wrapper)
- **Routes Required**: None (theme context available to all routes)
- **Shared Components**: ThemeProvider (Material-UI), CssBaseline (Material-UI)

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Platform Infrastructure**: Provides foundational theme system for all UI components

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Provide Theme Context** (Platform Infrastructure): Infrastructure wrapper providing Material-UI theme context to all components
- **Configure Light Theme** (Platform Infrastructure): Define light mode color palette, typography scale, and component style overrides
- **Configure Dark Theme** (Platform Infrastructure): Define dark mode color palette, typography scale, and component style overrides

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**: None (uses Material-UI theme interfaces)
- **External Dependencies**: Material-UI theming system, Redux (theme state from uiSlice)
- **Implementation Priority**: Already implemented

---

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Platform Infrastructure** → **Redux UI Slice**: Reads current theme mode ('light' | 'dark')
- **Platform Infrastructure** → **All Components**: Provides theme via Material-UI context

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: Theme mode from Redux uiSlice (selectTheme selector)
- **Interface Contracts**: Material-UI Theme interface, createTheme function, ThemeProvider component
- **Dependency Management**: Redux for theme state, Material-UI for theme system

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**: React functional component wrapping application with Material-UI ThemeProvider
- **Testing Strategy**: Theme provider renders, theme object created correctly, CssBaseline applied
- **Architecture Compliance**: Clean separation of theme configuration and application logic
- **Customization Guidance**:
  - Brand colors: Define primary, secondary, error, warning, info, success palettes for both light and dark modes
  - Typography: Configure font families, sizes, weights, and line heights for h1-h6, body1-body2, button, caption
  - Component overrides: Customize default styles for buttons, cards, inputs, dialogs to match brand identity

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Theme Configuration
- **Provide Theme Context**: Foundation infrastructure wrapper for all UI styling
- **Configure Light Theme**: Define complete light mode visual design system
- **Configure Dark Theme**: Define complete dark mode visual design system

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**: React, Material-UI, Redux Toolkit
- **Area Dependencies**: None (foundational infrastructure)
- **External Dependencies**: Material-UI theme system, Redux store with uiSlice

This Theme Management feature provides clear guidance for implementing consistent application theming within the Platform Infrastructure area while maintaining architectural integrity and brand consistency.
