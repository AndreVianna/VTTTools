# Application Layout Feature

**Original Request**: Extract Platform Infrastructure features from React component implementations

**Application Layout** is a UI infrastructure feature that provides consistent application structure across all pages. This feature affects the Platform Infrastructure area and enables all users to navigate the application with a professional, consistent layout including header, footer, and main content area.

---

## Change Log
- *2025-01-02* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from AppLayout.tsx component analysis

---

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Professional, consistent navigation and branding experience across all pages
- **Business Objective**: Provide unified application structure that reduces cognitive load and improves user confidence
- **Success Criteria**: All pages use consistent layout, theme toggle works reliably, navigation is intuitive

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Platform Infrastructure
- **Secondary Areas**: None (purely infrastructure)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: All feature pages render within this layout structure

---

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: yes
- **Primary UI Type**: WIDGET (Reusable layout wrapper)
- **UI Complexity**: Medium (responsive header/footer, dynamic user menu)
- **Estimated UI Components**: 1 main component (AppLayout) with header, footer, navigation sub-components

### Use Case UI Breakdown
- **Render Application Layout**: WIDGET - Wraps all page content with header and footer
- **Toggle Theme**: BUTTON - Icon button in application header
- **Navigate To Route**: BUTTON - Brand logo and menu items trigger navigation

### UI Integration Points
- **Navigation Entries**: Brand logo (home), user menu (profile, settings, logout), auth buttons (login, register)
- **Routes Required**: None directly (consumes routes from React Router)
- **Shared Components**: AppBar, Toolbar, IconButton, Button, Menu, MenuItem (Material-UI components)

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Platform Infrastructure**: Provides foundational layout structure for all pages

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Render Application Layout** (Platform Infrastructure): Display consistent header, footer, and content container
- **Toggle Theme** (Platform Infrastructure): Switch between light and dark theme modes
- **Navigate To Route** (Platform Infrastructure): Handle navigation to different pages via header controls

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**: None (uses existing React Router and Redux interfaces)
- **External Dependencies**: React Router (navigation), Redux (theme state), Auth context (user state)
- **Implementation Priority**: Already implemented

---

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Platform Infrastructure** → **Security**: Displays user authentication state in header
- **Platform Infrastructure** → **React Router**: Triggers navigation on brand/menu clicks
- **Platform Infrastructure** → **Redux UI Slice**: Reads theme state, dispatches theme toggle

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: Theme state from Redux, user state from Auth context, navigation from React Router
- **Interface Contracts**: `AppLayoutProps { children: ReactNode }`, Redux `uiSlice` actions/selectors
- **Dependency Management**: React Context for Auth, Redux for theme, React Router for navigation

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**: Component-based React development with Material-UI styling
- **Testing Strategy**: Render tests for layout structure, interaction tests for theme toggle and navigation
- **Architecture Compliance**: Clean separation of layout concerns, no domain logic in layout component

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Layout Structure
- **Render Application Layout**: Foundation for all page rendering

#### Phase 2: Interactive Controls
- **Toggle Theme**: User preference customization
- **Navigate To Route**: Navigation functionality

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**: React, Material-UI, React Router, Redux Toolkit
- **Area Dependencies**: None (foundational infrastructure)
- **External Dependencies**: Material-UI theme system, Redux store, Auth context provider

This Application Layout feature provides clear guidance for implementing consistent application structure within the Platform Infrastructure area while maintaining architectural integrity and separation of concerns.
