# Resource Management Feature

**Original Request**: Media area resource management capabilities for images, animations, and videos

**Resource Management** is a backend storage feature that enables media file upload, retrieval, metadata management, and blob storage integration for the VTT Tools platform. This feature affects the Media area and enables Game Masters to store, organize, and serve media resources used throughout the application.

## Change Log
- *2025-10-02* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from domain model

---

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Centralized media storage with tagging and organization capabilities
- **Business Objective**: Provide reliable, scalable media storage with efficient retrieval and metadata management
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Media upload success rate >99.5%
  - File retrieval latency <200ms for metadata, <1s for files
  - Zero data loss incidents
  - Tag-based search returns results <100ms

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Media
- **Secondary Areas**: None (self-contained storage)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: Assets and Library areas reference Media resources by ID

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: no
- **UI Components**: None (API/Backend feature)
- **Access Method**: RESTful API endpoints or internal services

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Media**: Core storage operations, blob storage integration, metadata management, resource lifecycle
- **Assets**: References Resource.Id for Asset.Display (read-only foreign key)
- **Library**: References Resource.Id for Scene/Adventure/Epic backgrounds (read-only foreign key)

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Upload Resource** (Media): Upload media file to blob storage and create Resource entity with metadata
- **Get Resource Metadata** (Media): Retrieve resource metadata by ID for display and validation
- **Get Resource File** (Media): Stream media file from blob storage for serving to clients
- **Delete Resource** (Media): Remove resource entity and blob storage file with reference checking
- **Update Resource Tags** (Media): Modify resource tags for organization and searchability
- **List All Resources** (Media): Retrieve all resources for administrative operations
- **List Resources By Type** (Media): Filter resources by type (Image, Animation, Video)
- **List Resources By Tag** (Media): Query resources by tag for organization and discovery

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**:
  - IMediaStorage (UploadAsync, GetByIdAsync, GetFileAsync, DeleteAsync, UpdateTagsAsync, GetAllAsync, GetByTypeAsync, GetByTagAsync)
  - IBlobStorageClient (infrastructure adapter for Azure Blob Storage or local filesystem)
  - IMediaMetadataExtractor (extract dimensions, file size, content type from uploaded files)
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Azure Blob Storage SDK or local filesystem adapter
  - Image processing library for metadata extraction (ImageSharp, FFmpeg for video)
  - EF Core DbContext for Resource entity persistence
- **Implementation Priority**: Upload → Retrieval → Deletion → Tag Management → Filtering

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Media** → **Assets**: Assets area queries Media for Resource metadata when displaying assets
- **Media** → **Library**: Library area queries Media for Resource file streams for scene backgrounds
- **Assets/Library** → **Media**: Check resource existence before creating references

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: Resource.Id shared as foreign key, no direct entity sharing
- **Interface Contracts**: IMediaStorage service contract in Domain layer, implementation in Infrastructure
- **Dependency Management**: Media has no dependencies on other areas; Assets and Library depend on Media

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**:
  - Backend-only feature (no React UI components)
  - Implement IMediaStorage service following DDD Contracts + Service Implementation pattern
  - Dual persistence: metadata in database (EF Core), files in blob storage
  - Transactional operations: upload file first, then create entity; delete entity first, then remove file
- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Unit tests for business rule validation (unique paths, type matching, reference checking)
  - Integration tests for blob storage operations with test containers
  - E2E tests for complete upload/download workflows
  - BDD scenarios for business rules (BR-01 through BR-07)
- **Architecture Compliance**:
  - RESTful API endpoints or internal services call IMediaStorage
  - Service coordinates Resource aggregate, enforces invariants
  - Infrastructure adapters handle blob storage and database persistence

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Storage Operations (Priority: Critical)
- **Upload Resource**: Foundation capability for media file upload with metadata extraction
- **Get Resource Metadata**: Essential for validation and display operations
- **Get Resource File**: Required for serving media files to clients

#### Phase 2: Resource Lifecycle Management (Priority: High)
- **Delete Resource**: Safe removal with reference checking
- **Update Resource Tags**: Organization and searchability enhancement

#### Phase 3: Discovery and Filtering (Priority: Medium)
- **List All Resources**: Administrative operations and bulk management
- **List Resources By Type**: Filter by media type for specialized workflows
- **List Resources By Tag**: Tag-based discovery and organization

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**:
  - Azure Blob Storage SDK or local filesystem adapter
  - EF Core DbContext with Resource entity mapping
  - Image/video processing library for metadata extraction
  - ASP.NET Core Web API or internal service host
- **Area Dependencies**: None (Media is foundational storage)
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Blob storage infrastructure (Azure Blob Storage in production, local filesystem in development)
  - Database infrastructure (SQL Server via EF Core)

This Resource Management feature provides comprehensive guidance for implementing centralized media storage within the Media area while maintaining architectural integrity and ensuring reliable, scalable storage operations for the VTT Tools platform.
