# Schedule Management Feature

**Original Request**: Generate complete specifications for Game area Schedule Management feature

**Schedule Management** is a backend feature that enables Game Masters to create recurring meeting schedules with flexible recurrence patterns (once, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and generate GameSession instances from schedules. This feature affects the Game area and enables Game Masters to plan ongoing campaigns with automated session creation.

---

## Change Log
- *2025-10-02* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from domain model extraction

---

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Game Masters can define recurring meeting patterns for campaigns with automated session generation and participant management
- **Business Objective**: Provide flexible scheduling system with recurrence patterns and automatic GameSession creation from schedule definitions
- **Success Criteria**: GMs can create schedules with various recurrence patterns, query upcoming schedules, generate session instances, manage schedule lifecycle independently from generated sessions

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Game
- **Secondary Areas**: None (self-contained within Game bounded context)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: References Identity context for User/Owner relationships, generates GameSession entities as independent aggregates

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: no
- **UI Components**: None (API/Backend feature)
- **Access Method**: API endpoints for backend services, frontend planned for future implementation

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Game**: Schedule entity lifecycle management, recurrence pattern processing, GameSession generation from schedules, persistence via IScheduleStorage

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Create Schedule** (Game): Define new recurring meeting schedule with start time, duration, participants, and recurrence pattern
- **Get Schedule** (Game): Retrieve schedule details by ID with participants and recurrence information
- **Update Schedule** (Game): Modify schedule properties including time, duration, participants, recurrence
- **Delete Schedule** (Game): Remove schedule (does not affect already generated sessions - BR-14)
- **List Schedules By Owner** (Game): Query all schedules owned by specific Game Master
- **List Upcoming Schedules** (Game): Query schedules with occurrences in specified date range
- **Generate Sessions From Schedule** (Game): Create GameSession instances from schedule based on recurrence pattern

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**: IScheduleStorage (domain service for persistence and session generation)
- **External Dependencies**: IGameSessionStorage (for generating sessions), User service (for owner/participant validation)
- **Implementation Priority**: Medium priority - enhances campaign organization, not required for immediate gameplay

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Game** → **Identity**: Owner and participant validation (UserId must exist in system)
- **Game** → **Game**: Schedule generates GameSession instances as independent aggregates (AGG-07, AGG-08)

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: Schedule entity with participants and recurrence, generated GameSessions are independent entities
- **Interface Contracts**: IScheduleStorage provides CRUD operations and session generation, IGameSessionStorage receives generated sessions
- **Dependency Management**: Foreign key constraints for OwnerId (User), generated sessions reference schedule via external calendar integration (EventId)

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**: DDD Contracts + Service Implementation - Schedule as aggregate root with Recurrence value object, session generation as domain service operation
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for recurrence pattern logic, integration tests for session generation, acceptance tests for schedule lifecycle
- **Architecture Compliance**: Enforce invariants INV-07 (future start), INV-08 (positive duration), INV-09 (valid recurrence), INV-10 (at least owner), AGG-06 (GM-only modifications), AGG-07 (session generation), AGG-08 (independent session lifecycle)

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Schedule CRUD
- **Create Schedule**: Foundation capability for schedule definition
- **Get Schedule**: Essential retrieval operation for schedule details
- **Update Schedule**: Modify schedule properties
- **Delete Schedule**: Cleanup operation for schedules

#### Phase 2: Schedule Queries
- **List Schedules By Owner**: Enable GM to view all their schedules
- **List Upcoming Schedules**: Support discovery of upcoming meetings

#### Phase 3: Session Generation
- **Generate Sessions From Schedule**: Automated GameSession creation from recurrence patterns

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**: EF Core for persistence, IGameSessionStorage for session creation, User service for validation, recurrence pattern calculation logic
- **Area Dependencies**: Identity context (User entity), GameSession entity for generation
- **External Dependencies**: Optional external calendar integration (EventId for sync)

This Schedule Management feature provides clear guidance for implementing flexible recurring meeting schedules within the Game area while maintaining aggregate independence and proper bounded context boundaries.
