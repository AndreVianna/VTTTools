# Event Management Feature

**Original Request**: Generate complete specifications for Game area Event Management feature

**Event Management** is a backend feature that enables recording of game actions and state changes during sessions (dice rolls, asset movements, status changes) with real-time notification via SignalR. This feature affects the Game area and enables comprehensive game action history tracking.

---

## Change Log
- *2025-10-02* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from domain model extraction

---

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Game Masters and participants have complete action history with timestamps for audit, replay, and analytics
- **Business Objective**: Provide append-only event log for game sessions capturing all significant actions and state changes
- **Success Criteria**: System records game events during InProgress or Paused sessions, events broadcast via SignalR, event history persisted with structured JSON data

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Game
- **Secondary Areas**: None (self-contained within Game bounded context)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: None (events are internal to game session)

---

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: no
- **UI Components**: None (API/Backend feature)
- **Access Method**: API endpoints for backend services with SignalR real-time broadcast, frontend planned for future implementation

---

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Game**: Event collection management within GameSession aggregate, append-only event persistence, SignalR hub integration in application layer

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Record Game Event** (Game): Append event to session history with type, timestamp, and structured JSON data payload

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**: IGameSessionStorage.AddEventAsync(), SignalR hub for real-time event distribution
- **External Dependencies**: SignalR infrastructure (application layer)
- **Implementation Priority**: Medium priority - important for session history and analytics

---

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Game** → **Game**: Events are internal to session aggregate, no external area dependencies

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: GameSessionEvent value objects within GameSession entity, real-time broadcast via SignalR
- **Interface Contracts**: IGameSessionStorage provides event append operation
- **Dependency Management**: Session must be InProgress or Paused to record events

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**: DDD Contracts + Service Implementation - GameSessionEvent as value object within GameSession aggregate, SignalR hub in application layer
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for event validation, integration tests for event persistence, acceptance tests for real-time distribution
- **Architecture Compliance**: Enforce invariants AGG-03 (append-only events), BR-09 (events ordered by timestamp), validate JSON data structure

---

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Event Recording
- **Record Game Event**: Foundation capability for tracking game actions and state changes

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**: EF Core for persistence, SignalR for real-time broadcast, GameSession must be InProgress or Paused
- **Area Dependencies**: None (self-contained)
- **External Dependencies**: SignalR infrastructure (application layer concern)

This Event Management feature provides clear guidance for implementing comprehensive game action history within the Game area while maintaining append-only event log integrity and architectural boundaries.
