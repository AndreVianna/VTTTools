# Participant Management Feature

**Original Request**: Generate complete specifications for Game area Participant Management feature

**Participant Management** is a backend feature that enables Game Masters to invite users to game sessions and remove participants, managing the roster of players, assistants, and guests. This feature affects the Game area and enables Game Masters to control who can participate in their game sessions.

## Change Log
- *2025-10-02* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from domain model extraction

---

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Game Masters can invite specific users to their sessions and manage participant roster with role assignments
- **Business Objective**: Provide participant roster management for game sessions with role-based access (Master, Player, Assistant, Guest)
- **Success Criteria**: GMs can add participants with specific roles, remove non-GM participants, maintain at least GM as Master, enforce single Master rule

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Game
- **Secondary Areas**: None (self-contained within Game bounded context)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: References Identity context for User validation

---

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: no
- **UI Components**: None (API/Backend feature)
- **Access Method**: API endpoints for backend services, frontend planned for future implementation

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Game**: Participant collection management within GameSession aggregate, role validation, Master uniqueness enforcement

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Add Participant** (Game): Invite user to session with specific role (Guest, Player, Assistant, Master)
- **Remove Participant** (Game): Remove user from session (cannot remove Game Master)

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**: IGameSessionStorage.AddParticipantAsync(), IGameSessionStorage.RemoveParticipantAsync()
- **External Dependencies**: User service (for user existence validation)
- **Implementation Priority**: High priority - essential for multi-user gameplay

---

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Game** → **Identity**: User validation when adding participants (UserId must exist)

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: Participant value objects within GameSession entity, shared via API responses
- **Interface Contracts**: IGameSessionStorage provides participant management operations
- **Dependency Management**: Foreign key validation for Participant.UserId referencing User.Id

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**: DDD Contracts + Service Implementation - Participant as value object within GameSession aggregate
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for role validation, integration tests for participant persistence, acceptance tests for Master uniqueness
- **Architecture Compliance**: Enforce invariants INV-03 (at least GM as Master), INV-04 (only one Master), AGG-04 (no changes when Finished), AGG-05 (GM-only operations)

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Participant Roster Management
- **Add Participant**: Foundation capability for inviting users to sessions
- **Remove Participant**: Essential removal operation for roster management

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**: EF Core for persistence, User service for validation, GameSession entity must exist
- **Area Dependencies**: Identity context (User entity)
- **External Dependencies**: None (self-contained backend service)

This Participant Management feature provides clear guidance for implementing participant roster control within the Game area while maintaining aggregate integrity and business rule enforcement.
