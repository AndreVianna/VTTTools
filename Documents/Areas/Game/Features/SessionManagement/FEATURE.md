# Session Management Feature

**Original Request**: Generate complete specifications for Game area Session Management feature

**Session Management** is a core backend feature that enables Game Masters to create, run, and control active game sessions (tabletop RPG meetings) with full lifecycle management. This feature affects the Game area and enables Game Masters to orchestrate live gameplay sessions with participants, scenes, chat, and events.

---

## Change Log
- *2025-10-02* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from domain model extraction

---

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Game Masters can create and manage active game sessions with complete control over session lifecycle, enabling organized tabletop RPG meetings
- **Business Objective**: Provide comprehensive session lifecycle management from creation through completion with status tracking and scene integration
- **Success Criteria**: GMs can create sessions, transition through all status states (Draft → Scheduled → InProgress ↔ Paused → Finished/Cancelled), manage active scenes, and maintain session history

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Game
- **Secondary Areas**: None (self-contained within Game bounded context)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: References Library context for Scene entities, Identity context for User/Owner relationships

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: no
- **UI Components**: None (API/Backend feature)
- **Access Method**: API endpoints for backend services, frontend planned for future implementation

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Game**: Core session lifecycle operations, status state machine, scene assignment, persistence via IGameSessionStorage

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Create Game Session** (Game): Initialize new game session with GM as owner and Master participant
- **Start Game Session** (Game): Transition session from Draft/Scheduled to InProgress status
- **Pause Game Session** (Game): Temporarily halt active session, transition to Paused status
- **Resume Game Session** (Game): Continue paused session, transition back to InProgress status
- **Finish Game Session** (Game): Complete session, transition to Finished status with end timestamp
- **Cancel Game Session** (Game): Abort session before completion, transition to Cancelled status
- **Get Game Session** (Game): Retrieve session details by ID with all participants, messages, events
- **Delete Game Session** (Game): Remove session from system (hard delete for Draft, soft delete otherwise)
- **List Game Sessions By Owner** (Game): Query all sessions owned by specific Game Master
- **List Active Game Sessions** (Game): Query all sessions currently in InProgress status
- **Set Active Scene** (Game): Assign or change active scene being used in session

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**: IGameSessionStorage (domain service for persistence and state management)
- **External Dependencies**: ISceneStorage (for scene reference validation), User service (for owner/participant validation)
- **Implementation Priority**: High priority - foundational feature for live gameplay

---

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Game** → **Library**: Scene reference validation when setting active scene (SceneId must exist)
- **Game** → **Identity**: Owner and participant validation (UserId must exist in system)

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: GameSession entity with status, participants, messages, events shared with frontend via API
- **Interface Contracts**: IGameSessionStorage provides all CRUD and state management operations
- **Dependency Management**: Foreign key constraints for OwnerId (User) and SceneId (Scene, nullable)

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**: DDD Contracts + Service Implementation pattern - anemic entities with logic in application services
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for status transitions, integration tests for persistence, acceptance tests for state machine compliance
- **Architecture Compliance**: Enforce status transition state machine (BR-05), validate all invariants (INV-01 through INV-06, AGG-01 through AGG-05)

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Session CRUD
- **Create Game Session**: Foundation capability for session initialization
- **Get Game Session**: Essential retrieval operation for session details
- **Delete Game Session**: Cleanup operation for draft sessions

#### Phase 2: Session Lifecycle Management
- **Start Game Session**: Enable transition to active gameplay
- **Pause Game Session**: Support temporary gameplay interruption
- **Resume Game Session**: Support continuation from pause
- **Finish Game Session**: Complete session lifecycle
- **Cancel Game Session**: Handle session abortion

#### Phase 3: Session Queries and Scene Management
- **List Game Sessions By Owner**: Enable GM to view all their sessions
- **List Active Game Sessions**: Support discovery of ongoing sessions
- **Set Active Scene**: Enable tactical map assignment during gameplay

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**: EF Core for persistence, ISceneStorage for scene validation, User service for authentication/authorization
- **Area Dependencies**: Library context (Scene entity), Identity context (User entity)
- **External Dependencies**: None (self-contained backend service)
