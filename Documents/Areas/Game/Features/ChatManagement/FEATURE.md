# Chat Management Feature

**Original Request**: Generate complete specifications for Game area Chat Management feature

**Chat Management** is a backend feature that enables participants to send text messages and commands during active game sessions with real-time distribution via SignalR. This feature affects the Game area and enables all session participants to communicate during gameplay.

---

## Change Log
- *2025-10-02* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from domain model extraction

---

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Session participants can communicate in real-time during gameplay with persistent chat history
- **Business Objective**: Provide text-based communication channel for game sessions with append-only message history
- **Success Criteria**: Participants can send messages during InProgress or Paused sessions, messages broadcast via SignalR, chat history persisted with timestamps

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Game
- **Secondary Areas**: None (self-contained within Game bounded context)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: References Identity context for sender validation

---

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: no
- **UI Components**: None (API/Backend feature)
- **Access Method**: API endpoints for backend services with SignalR real-time broadcast, frontend planned for future implementation

---

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Game**: Message collection management within GameSession aggregate, append-only message persistence, SignalR hub integration in application layer

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Send Chat Message** (Game): Append message to session chat history with timestamp and sender information

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**: IGameSessionStorage.AddMessageAsync(), SignalR hub for real-time message distribution
- **External Dependencies**: User service (for sender validation), SignalR infrastructure (application layer)
- **Implementation Priority**: High priority - critical for player communication during gameplay

---

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Game** → **Identity**: Sender validation (UserId must be session participant)

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: GameSessionMessage value objects within GameSession entity, real-time broadcast via SignalR
- **Interface Contracts**: IGameSessionStorage provides message append operation
- **Dependency Management**: Sender must be participant in session (validated against Participants collection)

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**: DDD Contracts + Service Implementation - GameSessionMessage as value object within GameSession aggregate, SignalR hub in application layer
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for message validation, integration tests for message persistence, acceptance tests for real-time distribution
- **Architecture Compliance**: Enforce invariants AGG-03 (append-only messages), BR-09 (messages ordered by timestamp), validate sender is participant

---

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Chat Message Management
- **Send Chat Message**: Foundation capability for participant communication during sessions

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**: EF Core for persistence, SignalR for real-time broadcast, User service for validation, GameSession must be InProgress or Paused
- **Area Dependencies**: Identity context (User entity for sender)
- **External Dependencies**: SignalR infrastructure (application layer concern)

This Chat Management feature provides clear guidance for implementing real-time participant communication within the Game area while maintaining append-only message history and architectural integrity.
