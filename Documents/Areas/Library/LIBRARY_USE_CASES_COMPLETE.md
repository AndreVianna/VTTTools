## Summary

**Total Use Cases**: 23
- **Epic Management**: 5 use cases (Create, Get, Update, Delete, Get By Owner)
- **Campaign Management**: 5 use cases (Create, Update, Get By Epic, Move To Epic, Make Standalone)
- **Adventure Management**: 5 use cases (Create, Update, Clone, Move To Campaign, Make Standalone)
- **Scene Management**: 8 use cases (Create, Update, Configure Stage, Configure Grid, Place Asset, Move Asset, Remove Asset, Clone)

**Common Patterns**:
- **Authentication**: All operations require authenticated user (OwnerId)
- **Authorization**: AGG-02 enforced across all entities (only owner can modify)
- **Validation**: INV-01 through INV-11 enforced via application services
- **Domain Events**: All state-changing operations publish domain events
- **Hierarchy Management**: Optional parent references (nullable FKs) enable flexible standalone/nested usage
- **Cascade Operations**: Delete operations cascade to owned children (AGG-01, AGG-03, AGG-05)
- **Value Objects**: Stage, Grid, SceneAsset are immutable and validated
- **Cloning**: Adventure and Scene support deep copy operations for reuse

**Architecture Compliance**:
- **Clean Architecture**: Application services orchestrate, domain entities are contracts, infrastructure provides persistence
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Primary ports (ILibraryStorage) define operations, secondary ports (IUserStorage, IMediaStorage, IAssetStorage, IGameSessionStorage) provide external dependencies
- **DDD**: Bounded context (Library), aggregates (Epic, Campaign, Adventure, Scene with context-dependent roots), domain events, ubiquitous language

**API Endpoints**:
All use cases exposed as RESTful API endpoints (API_ENDPOINT UI type), frontend Scene Editor UI in progress.
