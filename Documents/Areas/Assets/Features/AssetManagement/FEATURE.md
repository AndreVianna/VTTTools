# Asset Management Feature

**Original Request**: Manage reusable game asset templates for VTT Tools platform

**Asset Management** is a content management feature that enables creation, modification, retrieval, and deletion of reusable game asset templates (creatures, characters, NPCs, objects, tokens, walls, doors, effects). This feature affects the Assets area and enables Game Masters to organize and maintain their library of game assets for use in adventures and scenes.

## Change Log
- *2025-10-02* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from domain model

---

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Centralized management of reusable game elements with powerful organization and search capabilities
- **Business Objective**: Provide efficient asset library management reducing preparation time for Game Masters
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Asset creation completion rate >95%
  - Average asset retrieval time <200ms
  - Zero data loss incidents
  - Asset reuse rate >70% (assets used in multiple scenes)

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Assets
- **Secondary Areas**: Identity (ownership), Media (display resources)
- **Cross-Area Impact**:
  - Identity: Asset ownership linked to User entities
  - Media: Asset display properties reference Resource entities
  - Library: Scenes reference Asset templates for placement

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: yes (future implementation)
- **Primary UI Type**: API_ENDPOINT (backend implementation priority)
- **UI Complexity**: High - grid views, filters, search, bulk operations
- **Estimated UI Components**: 12 components (asset grid, asset cards, filters, search, forms, detail views)

### Use Case UI Breakdown
- **Create Asset**: API_ENDPOINT - No UI yet (backend only)
- **Get Asset**: API_ENDPOINT - No UI yet (backend only)
- **Update Asset**: API_ENDPOINT - No UI yet (backend only)
- **Delete Asset**: API_ENDPOINT - No UI yet (backend only)
- **List Assets**: API_ENDPOINT - No UI yet (backend only)
- **List Assets By Owner**: API_ENDPOINT - No UI yet (backend only)
- **List Public Assets**: API_ENDPOINT - No UI yet (backend only)
- **List Assets By Type**: API_ENDPOINT - No UI yet (backend only)

### UI Integration Points
- **Navigation Entries**: "Asset Library" menu item (future)
- **Routes Required**: /assets, /assets/:id, /assets/new, /assets/:id/edit (future)
- **Shared Components**: AssetCard, AssetGrid, AssetFilters, AssetTypeSelector (future)

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Assets**: Core CRUD operations for Asset entities, type categorization, ownership enforcement
- **Identity**: Ownership validation - assets linked to User.Id via OwnerId foreign key
- **Media**: Display resource references - assets reference Resource.Id via Display value object
- **Library**: Scene placement - SceneAsset references Asset.Id when placing assets on scenes

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Create Asset** (Assets): Create new asset template with validation
- **Get Asset** (Assets): Retrieve single asset by ID with authorization check
- **Update Asset** (Assets): Modify existing asset properties with ownership validation
- **Delete Asset** (Assets): Remove asset if not in use with cascade checks
- **List Assets** (Assets): Query all assets with optional filtering (admin operation)
- **List Assets By Owner** (Assets): Query assets owned by specific user
- **List Public Assets** (Assets): Query publicly visible assets (IsPublic=true)
- **List Assets By Type** (Assets): Query assets filtered by AssetType enum

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**:
  - IAssetStorage (8 operations defined in domain model)
  - IAssetAuthorizationService (ownership and permission checks)
- **External Dependencies**:
  - User entity from Identity context (via OwnerId)
  - Resource entity from Media context (via Display.ResourceId)
  - SceneAsset query for usage checks (Library context)
- **Implementation Priority**: Phase 1 (CRUD operations) → Phase 2 (Query operations) → Phase 3 (Frontend UI)

---

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Assets** → **Identity**: Validate OwnerId references existing User during creation
- **Assets** → **Media**: Validate Display.ResourceId references existing Image Resource
- **Assets** ← **Library**: Check SceneAsset usage before allowing deletion
- **Identity** → **Assets**: User deletion should handle orphaned assets (cascade or reassign)

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: Asset.Id shared with Library for scene placement references
- **Interface Contracts**:
  - IAssetStorage interface defines 8 operations (domain layer contract)
  - Application services implement IAssetStorage (infrastructure layer)
  - REST/GraphQL adapters expose operations via HTTP
- **Dependency Management**: Assets depends on Identity and Media for validation, Library depends on Assets for references

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**:
  - Backend-first implementation (API endpoints)
  - DDD Contracts + Service Implementation pattern
  - Anemic entities with behavior in application services
  - Repository pattern for persistence
- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Unit tests for validation rules (INV-01 through INV-06)
  - Integration tests for service operations
  - BDD scenarios for business rules (BR-01 through BR-09)
  - E2E tests for complete workflows (future UI implementation)
- **Architecture Compliance**:
  - Clean Architecture layers (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → UI)
  - Hexagonal Architecture ports/adapters (IAssetStorage as port)
  - DDD aggregate boundaries (Asset aggregate root with Display/Frame value objects)

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core CRUD Operations (Priority: Critical)
- **Create Asset**: Foundation capability for asset creation with validation
- **Get Asset**: Essential retrieval operation for detail views
- **Update Asset**: Modify asset properties with ownership checks
- **Delete Asset**: Remove assets with usage validation

#### Phase 2: Query Operations (Priority: High)
- **List Assets**: Admin operation for all assets
- **List Assets By Owner**: User's personal asset library
- **List Public Assets**: Community-shared assets browsing
- **List Assets By Type**: Filtered queries by asset category

#### Phase 3: Frontend UI (Priority: Medium, future work)
- Asset library grid view
- Asset creation/edit forms
- Asset detail pages
- Search and filter components

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**:
  - EF Core for persistence
  - ASP.NET Core for REST API
  - Identity area for User entity
  - Media area for Resource entity
- **Area Dependencies**:
  - Identity: User entity and authentication
  - Media: Resource entity for images
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Database (SQL Server or PostgreSQL)
  - File storage for asset images (Azure Blob or S3)

This Asset Management feature provides comprehensive guidance for implementing asset library operations within the Assets area while maintaining architectural integrity and area boundary respect.
