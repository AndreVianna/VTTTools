# Account Management Feature

**Original Request**: Identity area user profile and security settings management

**Account Management** is a user account administration feature that enables users to view and modify their profile information, security settings, and authentication preferences. This feature affects the Identity area and enables authenticated users to manage their personal information, security configurations, and account preferences within VTT Tools.

## Change Log
- *2025-01-15* — **1.0.0** — Feature specification created from React implementation analysis
- *2025-01-15* — **1.1.0** — All 6 use cases identified and documented

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Complete control over account information, security settings, and privacy preferences
- **Business Objective**: Empower users to self-manage accounts, reducing support burden and improving user satisfaction
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Profile update completion rate >90%
  - 2FA setup completion rate >35% of active users
  - Account security incidents <0.1% of user base
  - Self-service profile management reduces support tickets by 60%

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Identity
- **Secondary Areas**: None (self-contained account management)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: Other areas consume updated user profile data (username, avatar) via Identity

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: yes
- **Primary UI Type**: FORM within settings pages/dialogs
- **UI Complexity**: Medium - multiple forms with validation, modals for sensitive operations
- **Estimated UI Components**: 6 major components (ProfileSettings, SecuritySettings, 2FA setup, recovery codes manager)

### Use Case UI Breakdown
- **View Profile Settings**: FORM - Location: /settings/profile page with edit mode toggle
- **Update Profile**: FORM - Location: ProfileSettings component in edit mode
- **View Security Settings**: FORM - Location: /settings/security page with list of security options
- **Setup Two Factor Authentication**: MODAL - Location: Dialog triggered from SecuritySettings with QR code display
- **Manage Recovery Codes**: MODAL - Location: Dialog triggered from SecuritySettings with code list
- **Change Password**: MODAL - Location: Dialog triggered from SecuritySettings with password fields

### UI Integration Points
- **Navigation Entries**: "Profile Settings" and "Security & Privacy" in user menu
- **Routes Required**: /settings/profile, /settings/security (or tab-based single /settings route)
- **Shared Components**: AuthTextField, AuthSubmitButton, SecuritySettings list items, modals

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Identity**: User profile management, security configuration, 2FA setup, password changes
- **All Areas**: Consume updated user profile data (username, avatar URL) from Identity

### Use Case Breakdown
- **View Profile Settings** (Identity): Display current user profile information in settings interface
- **Update Profile** (Identity): Modify user profile data (username, phone, avatar)
- **View Security Settings** (Identity): Display security status and available security options
- **Setup Two Factor Authentication** (Identity): Configure TOTP-based 2FA with authenticator app
- **Manage Recovery Codes** (Identity): View, regenerate, and download backup recovery codes
- **Change Password** (Identity): Update account password with current password verification

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**:
  - IProfileService (update profile, upload avatar)
  - ISecurityService (change password, enable/disable 2FA)
  - ITwoFactorSetupService (generate secret, verify setup)
  - IRecoveryCodeService (generate codes, regenerate codes)
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Blob storage service for avatar uploads (Azure Blob, AWS S3)
  - TOTP library for 2FA QR code generation
  - Secure random generation for recovery codes
- **Implementation Priority**: Phase 1 (Profile) → Phase 2 (Password) → Phase 3 (2FA/Recovery Codes)

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Identity** → **All Areas**: Publishes UserProfileUpdated, TwoFactorEnabled domain events
- **All Areas** → **Identity**: Query updated user profile data via AuthContext

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: User profile updates propagate via Auth Context state updates
- **Interface Contracts**: Clean separation between UI, Application Services, and Domain
- **Dependency Management**: Identity is foundational - consumed by all areas

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**:
  - UI components already implemented (React/TypeScript/MUI)
  - Requires backend Application Services and Domain layer implementation
  - Follow DDD Contracts + Service Implementation pattern
- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Unit tests for validation logic
  - Integration tests for profile/security update flows
  - E2E tests for complete user journeys
  - BDD scenarios for security requirements
- **Architecture Compliance**:
  - React UI calls Application Services via HTTP/GraphQL
  - Services coordinate Domain Entities (User, TwoFactorSetup, RecoveryCode)
  - Infrastructure adapters handle persistence, blob storage, TOTP generation

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Profile Management (Priority: High)
- **View Profile Settings**: Essential for users to see their current information
- **Update Profile**: Core account management capability
- **Rationale**: Basic account management features users expect immediately

#### Phase 2: Password Management (Priority: High)
- **Change Password**: Essential security feature for account protection
- **Rationale**: Users need ability to update passwords for security

#### Phase 3: Advanced Security (Priority: Medium)
- **View Security Settings**: Dashboard for security status and options
- **Setup Two Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security feature
- **Manage Recovery Codes**: Backup authentication for 2FA users
- **Rationale**: Advanced security features for users who want enhanced protection

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**:
  - React Router for navigation ✓ (implemented)
  - Material-UI for components ✓ (implemented)
  - useAuth hook for state management ✓ (implemented)
  - Backend API endpoints (required)
  - Blob storage for avatars (required)
  - TOTP library for 2FA (required)
- **Area Dependencies**: None (Identity is foundational)
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Blob storage service (Azure/AWS/local file storage)
  - TOTP library (otplib, speakeasy)
  - QR code generation library (qrcode.react)
