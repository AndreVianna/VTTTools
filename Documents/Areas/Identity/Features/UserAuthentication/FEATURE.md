# User Authentication Feature

**Original Request**: Identity area authentication and user management capabilities

**User Authentication** is a security feature that enables secure user access and session management for the VTT Tools platform. This feature affects the Identity area and enables Game Masters and Players to securely access their accounts, manage authentication credentials, and maintain secure sessions across the platform.

## Feature Overview

### Business Value
- **User Benefit**: Secure, convenient access to VTT Tools with multiple authentication options including 2FA
- **Business Objective**: Provide enterprise-grade authentication security while maintaining excellent user experience for tabletop gaming community. Achieve 99.9% uptime while maintaining <2 second average login time.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Zero authentication-related security breaches
  - Login completion rate >95%
  - 2FA adoption rate >30% among active users
  - Password reset flow completion >90%

### Area Assignment
- **Primary Area**: Identity
- **Secondary Areas**: None (self-contained authentication)
- **Cross-Area Impact**: All areas depend on Identity for user authentication state

## UI Presentation

### Feature UI Overview
- **Has UI Components**: yes
- **Primary UI Type**: FULL_PAGE with modal dialogs and embedded forms
- **UI Complexity**: High - multi-mode authentication flows with state transitions
- **Estimated UI Components**: 8 major components (LoginPage, various forms, auth status)

### Use Case UI Breakdown
- **Render Login Page**: FULL_PAGE - Route: /login with mode-based form rendering
- **Handle Login**: FORM - Location: LoginPage with SimpleLoginForm component
- **Handle Registration**: FORM - Location: /register or LoginPage register mode
- **Handle Logout**: BUTTON - Location: Header user menu with confirmation dialog
- **Verify Two Factor Code**: FORM - Location: LoginPage two-factor mode
- **Verify Recovery Code**: FORM - Location: LoginPage recovery-code mode
- **Request Password Reset**: FORM - Location: LoginPage reset-request mode
- **Confirm Password Reset**: FORM - Location: LoginPage reset-confirm mode (with email+token params)
- **Display Auth Status**: WIDGET - Location: Application header with user menu

### UI Integration Points
- **Navigation Entries**: Login, Register links in header (unauthenticated); User menu (authenticated)
- **Routes Required**: /login, /register, /login?email={email}&token={token} (reset confirm)
- **Shared Components**: SimpleLoginForm, SimpleRegistrationForm, AuthStatus, LogoutButton

## Architecture Analysis

### Area Impact Assessment
- **Identity**: Core authentication logic, session management, credential validation, 2FA operations
- **All Areas**: Consume authentication state from Identity for authorization decisions

### Use Case Breakdown
- **Render Login Page** (Identity): Display multi-mode authentication interface with routing integration
- **Handle Login** (Identity): Authenticate users with email/password credentials
- **Handle Registration** (Identity): Create new user accounts with validation
- **Handle Logout** (Identity): Terminate user sessions and clear authentication state
- **Verify Two Factor Code** (Identity): Complete 2FA authentication flow
- **Verify Recovery Code** (Identity): Authenticate using backup recovery codes
- **Request Password Reset** (Identity): Initiate password reset email flow
- **Confirm Password Reset** (Identity): Complete password reset with token validation
- **Display Auth Status** (Identity): Show current authentication state and user menu

### Architectural Integration
- **New Interfaces Needed**:
  - IAuthenticationService (login, register, logout, password operations)
  - ITwoFactorService (verify code, verify recovery code, generate setup)
  - ITokenValidationService (validate reset tokens)
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Email service for password reset and verification emails
  - Time-based OTP library for 2FA code generation/validation
  - Secure token generation service
- **Implementation Priority**: Phase 1 (Core authentication) → Phase 2 (Password reset) → Phase 3 (2FA)

## Technical Considerations

### Area Interactions
- **Identity** → **All Areas**: Publishes UserAuthenticated, UserLoggedOut domain events
- **All Areas** → **Identity**: Query current user authentication state via AuthContext

### Integration Requirements
- **Data Sharing**: User authentication state via React Context (useAuth hook)
- **Interface Contracts**: Clean separation between UI (React), Application Services, and Infrastructure
- **Dependency Management**: Identity is foundational - no dependencies on other areas

### Implementation Guidance
- **Development Approach**:
  - UI components already implemented (React/TypeScript/MUI)
  - Requires backend Application Services and Domain layer implementation
  - Follow DDD Contracts + Service Implementation pattern
- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Unit tests for validation logic and business rules
  - Integration tests for authentication flows
  - E2E tests for complete user journeys
  - BDD scenarios for security requirements
- **Architecture Compliance**:
  - React UI calls Application Services via HTTP/GraphQL
  - Services coordinate Domain Entities (User, Session, TwoFactorSetup)
  - Infrastructure adapters handle persistence, email, token generation

## Use Case Implementation Plan

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Authentication (Priority: Critical)
- **Render Login Page**: Foundation for all authentication UI flows
- **Handle Login**: Essential credential-based authentication
- **Handle Registration**: User account creation capability
- **Handle Logout**: Session termination and cleanup
- **Display Auth Status**: User authentication state visibility

#### Phase 2: Password Management (Priority: High)
- **Request Password Reset**: Self-service password recovery initiation
- **Confirm Password Reset**: Complete password reset flow with security

#### Phase 3: Advanced Security (Priority: Medium)
- **Verify Two Factor Code**: Enhanced security with TOTP authentication
- **Verify Recovery Code**: Backup authentication method for 2FA users

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Technical Dependencies**:
  - React Router for navigation ✓ (implemented)
  - Material-UI for components ✓ (implemented)
  - useAuth hook for state management ✓ (implemented)
  - Backend API endpoints (required)
- **Area Dependencies**: None (Identity is foundational)
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Email service for notifications
  - TOTP library for 2FA
  - Secure token generation
