# Use Case: Handle Logout

@use-case @authentication @session-management
Feature: Handle Logout
  As an authenticated VTT Tools user
  I want to securely log out of my account
  So that my session is terminated and my account is secure

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated and logged in
    And I have an active session with a valid token

  Rule: Logout always succeeds client-side regardless of server response

    @error-handling @resilience
    Scenario: Logout succeeds despite network error
      Given the logout API will fail with network error
      When I click the logout button
      Then the authentication token should be cleared anyway
      And the Auth Context should be reset
      And I should be redirected to the landing page
      And I should see a warning notification about incomplete server logout

    @error-handling @resilience
    Scenario: Logout succeeds despite server error
      Given the logout API will return 500 error
      When I click the logout button
      Then the authentication token should be cleared anyway
      And the Auth Context should be reset
      And I should be redirected to the landing page

  Rule: Logout executes immediately without confirmation

    @happy-path
    Scenario: Immediate logout without confirmation dialog
      When I click the logout button
      Then the logout should execute immediately
      And I should be logged out

  @security @redux
  Scenario: Logout clears client authentication state
    Given I am authenticated with session cookie
    When I successfully log out
    Then the session cookie should be cleared by the server
    And Redux authSlice.isAuthenticated should be false
    And Redux authSlice.user should be null
    And I should not be able to access protected routes

  @integration @ignore
  Scenario: Logout updates authentication context globally
    Given I am logged in across multiple components
    When I log out
    Then the Auth Context user should be set to null
    And all components should reflect unauthenticated state
    And protected routes should become inaccessible
    And the header should show login/register buttons


  @edge-case
  Scenario: Handle logout with expired token
    Given my session token has expired
    When I click the logout button
    Then the client should clear the token anyway
    And the server should return 401 error
    And I should still be logged out successfully
    And I should be redirected to the landing page

  @edge-case
  Scenario: Handle logout with already terminated session
    Given my session was terminated by another process
    When I click the logout button
    Then the server should return 404 error
    And the client should clear state anyway
    And I should be logged out successfully

  @security
  Scenario: Logout clears sensitive application state
    Given I have loaded sensitive user data in the application
    When I log out
    Then all user-specific data should be cleared from state


  @navigation
  Scenario: Redirect to landing page after logout
    Given I am on the dashboard page
    When I successfully log out
    Then I should be redirected to the landing page
    And I should see the public landing page content
    And I should see login and register options

  @accessibility @ignore
  Scenario: Logout button is accessible
    Given I am using a screen reader
    When I focus on the logout button
    Then the button should be announced as "Logout"
    And the button action should be clear
    And the confirmation dialog should be accessible if shown
