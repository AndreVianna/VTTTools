## Architecture Principles & Standards

### Mandatory Architecture Standards
- **Domain-Driven Design**: 10 bounded contexts with clear domain boundaries and ubiquitous language
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters pattern with storage interfaces and multiple storage implementations
- **Clean Architecture**: Layer separation following the dependency rule (Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Single responsibility enforced across layers (Domain/Data/WebApp/Core separation)
- **Well-Defined Contracts**: Clear storage interfaces between application and infrastructure layers
- **KISS Principle**: Straightforward entity relationships, minimal abstraction overhead

### Architecture Decisions
- **Domain Boundaries**: Identity handles users/roles, Assets handles reusable game pieces, Media handles file storage, Library handles content hierarchy, Game handles active sessions
- **Dependency Flow**: UI → Application (Core) → Domain ← Infrastructure (Data, Storage)
- **Communication Patterns**: REST API for standard operations, SignalR for real-time collaboration
- **Complexity Justification**: Three-tier content hierarchy (Epic → Campaign → Adventure) supports flexible game content organization, owned entities reduce database joins
- **Simplification Applied**: Flat participant structure instead of complex user-session relationships, single Resource entity for all media types, storage interface abstraction allows easy adapter swapping

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Project Identity & Value (15 points)
✅ 5pts: Product type clearly defined (Virtual Tabletop Tools Platform)
✅ 5pts: Target user type and primary workflow explicit (Game Masters and Players)
✅ 5pts: Interface type and interaction method specified (SPA via web browser)

## UI Architecture (has_frontend = yes)
✅ UI framework and version specified (Material-UI 7.3.2)
✅ Routing library and state management defined (React Router 7.9.1, Redux Toolkit 2.9.0)
✅ Layout pattern and navigation type documented (AppLayout with ErrorBoundary, client-side routing)
✅ Supported UI types listed (FULL_PAGE, MODAL, FORM, WIDGET, BUTTON)
✅ Route organization structure defined (7 routes documented)

## Domain Architecture (DDD) (30 points)
✅ 10pts: Bounded contexts identified with clear responsibilities (10 contexts: Identity, Assets, Media, Library, Game, Common, Data, Auth, WebApp, Core)
✅ 5pts: Domain interactions documented with direction (Library→Media, Assets→Media, Game→Library, etc.)
✅ 5pts: Ubiquitous language defined (13 core domain terms: GM, Player, Adventure, Scene, Asset, Token, Meeting, Epic, Campaign, Stage, Grid, Frame, Resource, Participant)
✅ 5pts: Domain entities, value objects, services specified per context (15 entities, 11 value objects, 5 storage services)
⚠️ 5pts: Domain events identified for state changes (NOT IMPLEMENTED - documented as N/A)

## Clean Architecture (25 points)
✅ 10pts: Domain layer complete (15 entities, 11 value objects, 10 enums, storage interfaces)
✅ 5pts: Application layer defined (10 use case categories with workflows)
✅ 5pts: Infrastructure layer specified (EF Core adapters, Azure Blob, Redis cache, SignalR hubs)
✅ 5pts: Dependency rule compliance validated (Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure)

## Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) (15 points)
✅ 5pts: Primary ports defined (REST API controllers, SignalR hubs)
✅ 5pts: Secondary ports defined (5 storage interfaces: IAssetStorage, IMediaStorage, ISceneStorage, IAdventureStorage, IGameSessionStorage)
✅ 3pts: Primary adapters specified (ASP.NET Core WebApp, SignalR Hubs, React SPA)
✅ 2pts: Secondary adapters specified (EF Core Storage, Azure Blob, Local FileSystem, Azurite)

## Implementation Guidance (15 points)
✅ 5pts: Technology stack specified with versions (22 technologies with versions)
✅ 5pts: Implementation priority follows architecture-first approach (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → UI)
✅ 5pts: Development phases documented with status (Phase 1 complete, Phases 2-3 in progress, Phase 5 planned)

## Target Score: 95/100 (Domain Events not implemented)

### Extraction Quality Notes:
✅ Comprehensive entity coverage (100%)
✅ Complete enum value extraction (100%)
✅ All bounded contexts identified from project structure
✅ Technology stack verified from package.json and .csproj files
✅ UI architecture fully documented from React component analysis
✅ Development phase context from ROADMAP.md
⚠️ Domain events marked as "not currently implemented" (honest documentation)
