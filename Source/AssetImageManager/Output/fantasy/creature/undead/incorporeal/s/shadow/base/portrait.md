A vivid full-view portrait illustration of an undead incorporeal Shadow: a medium undead, a two-dimensional humanoid silhouette pressed against a damp crypt wall. The silhouette is entirely flat, black, and featureless, with no volume or shading, and a darker void where the face should be. Its edges subtly writhe and shift, like living shadow projected onto rough stone. It drains light and warmth as it passes, leaving a chill, dark aura around it and dimming nearby surfaces with icy bluish undertones. The setting is a crypt, graveyard, or haunted ruins—crumbling arches, mossy stone, tomb alcoves, and faint, flickering torchlight in the gloom. The subject should occupy the full height of the frame, centered, with no other figures or objects competing for attention. Style: high-contrast, painterly realism in a restrained palette of black, charcoal gray, and icy blue; mood: eerie, silent, oppressive. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or cropping; the entire silhouette must be clearly visible and undistorted.
