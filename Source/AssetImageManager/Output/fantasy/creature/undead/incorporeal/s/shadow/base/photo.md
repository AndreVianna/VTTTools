Close-up, high-detail illustration of an undead incorporeal shadow. A medium undead depicted as a dark, two-dimensional humanoid silhouette with no facial features, only a darker void where the face should be. It stands against a flat, solid neutral gray wall (no texture), forming a featureless silhouette that subtly shifts and writhes. The form moves silently, draining light and warmth from the surface it passes, leaving a cold darkness aura that clings to the edges. A faint bluish glow outlines the silhouette, emphasizing its incorporeal nature. No borders, frames, text, watermark, or additional subjects; tight crop for use as a token on a virtual tabletop map.
