Close-up illustration of an undead incorporeal specter: translucent, floating ghost humanoid with hollow eyes and a face twisted in eternal anguish; tattered spectral robes flow around its form; long ghostly fingers reach forward; radiating a cold malevolent aura; its touch drains life force and can spawn new entities; high-detail rendering of translucent skin, ragged robe texture, and subtle glow/mist; solid neutral background; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or signatures; no other subjects or scenery; fully visible head and hands, not cropped.
