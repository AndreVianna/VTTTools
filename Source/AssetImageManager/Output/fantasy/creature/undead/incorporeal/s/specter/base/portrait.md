Full-body, ultra-detailed fantasy illustration of an undead incorporeal specter. A translucent, floating humanoid with hollow eyes and a face twisted in eternal anguish. It wears tattered spectral robes that flow and billow, ragged edges fluttering as mist, revealing hints of bone and inner glow. Ghostly hands reach outward, fingers elongated, radiating a cold blue aura that drains life force. The setting is a crypt/graveyard/haunted ruins at night: cracked stone walls, moss-draped tombs, broken arches, weathered gravestones, and creeping fog. Moonlight and pale spectral glow filter through gaps, casting long eerie shadows and frost wisps in the air. Color palette: icy blues, ghostly whites, desaturated greens and grays. Composition centers the full figure in a hovering pose with cinematic depth of field, ensuring a vivid, full-view portrait suitable for a book illustration or display panel. No borders, frames, text, watermark, or duplicates.
