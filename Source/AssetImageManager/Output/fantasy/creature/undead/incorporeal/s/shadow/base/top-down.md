Bird's-eye top-down view of an undead incorporeal shadow: a flat, two-dimensional humanoid silhouette oriented toward the top edge as if looking forward. The silhouette is a dark, featureless form with no facial features, a deeper void where the face would be. It clings to and writhes along two featureless walls meeting in a corner on a plain tabletop map; no scenery or environment details. The shadow is incorporeal and silent, its edges softly undulating and shifting as it passes, draining light and warmth from surfaces and leaving an aura of cold darkness in its wake. Grayscale palette: pure black silhouette against pale gray walls, with smoky, translucent edges. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or additional subjects; no cropping or partial bodies; no indication of facing the viewer or looking up.
