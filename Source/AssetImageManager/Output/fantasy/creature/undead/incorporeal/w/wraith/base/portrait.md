A full-body, full-view portrait of an undead wraith: a medium incorporeal spirit of pure hatred, a hooded skeletal figure wrapped in shadowy robes, floating above the ground. The hood hides most of the skull, but two glowing red eyes burn within the deep hood. Spectral robes flow and ripple with dark energy, wisps of shadow curling around the form. The wraith’s hands are outstretched, skeletal fingers extended as if draining life, a cold dark aura emanating from them. The presence drains warmth and light from the surroundings, casting the scene in a dim, bluish gloom. Setting: crypts, graveyards, and haunted ruins—cracked tombs, toppled obelisks, decaying mausoleums, iron gates, and creeping mist under pale moonlight. Palette: desaturated cool tones—deep blacks, midnight blues, purples—with the red eyes as a piercing focal point. Style: high fantasy Gothic realism, ultra-detailed textures, dramatic cinematic lighting, painterly rendering. Composition: centered, no borders or frames, no text, no watermarks; single subject, no cropping; full, sharp anatomy.
