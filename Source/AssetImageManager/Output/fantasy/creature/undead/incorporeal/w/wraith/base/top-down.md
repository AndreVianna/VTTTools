Top-down bird's-eye view illustration of a single undead incorporeal wraith, oriented forward along the map's axis (toward the bottom edge of the frame) as seen from above, face obscured by a hood, not front-on to the viewer; full-body, ethereal skeleton wrapped in shadowy robes; glowing red eyes visible within the deep hood; spectral robes flow and swirl with dark energy; hands outstretched to drain life; the wraith floats, radiating a cold, light-draining presence; high-detail fantasy illustration optimized for seamless tabletop map integration; transparent background; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or signatures; no other subjects, no scenery or environmental details; crisp linework with subtle glow effects; color palette dominated by obsidian blacks, deep purples, and crimson eye glow.
