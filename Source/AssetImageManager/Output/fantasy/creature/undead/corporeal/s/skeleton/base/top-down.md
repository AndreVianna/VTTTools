Bird's-eye top-down view of a medium undead corporeal Skeleton, animated bones held together by dark magic, moving with jerky, unnatural motions as it lurches forward along the map's forward axis. Its empty eye sockets glow dim green necromantic energy; bones rattle with each step; it wears tattered remnants of armor on shoulders and chest. It wields a single weapon—a rusted iron greatsword—clutched in a bony grip, with clockwork-like gears at joints to suggest mechanical precision. Scene on a transparent background with no scenery, borders, or text, suitable for a tabletop map token.
