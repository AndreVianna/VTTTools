Full-body, high-detail portrait illustration of a medium undead corporeal skeleton animated by dark magic. The skeleton moves with jerky, unnatural motions; bones rattle with every step and empty eye sockets glow with a dim green necromantic light. It wears tattered remnants of armor—cracked plate and torn leather—fitted to its skeletal frame, and grips a weapon (a rusted halberd with faint necromantic runes) in a bony grip, raised as if poised to strike with mechanical precision. The setting is a crypt, graveyard, or haunted ruins—crumbling stone, flickering torches or pale moonlight, and creeping fog. Lighting is cinematic: cool green glow from eye sockets contrasting with warm torchlight, deep shadows, rich textures on bone and armor, and subtle motes of necromantic energy. The image is a single subject, full view, no borders, text, watermarks, or crop lines; presented in a painterly digital painting style or hyper-real 3D-rendered look, with immaculate anatomical detail of skull, ribs, pelvis, limbs, joints, and armor remnants. The mood is eerie, ominous, and otherworldly.
