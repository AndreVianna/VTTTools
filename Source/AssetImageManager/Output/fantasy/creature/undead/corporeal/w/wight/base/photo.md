Ultra-detailed close-up illustration of a corporeal undead wight: a medium undead warrior with desiccated flesh clinging to exposed bones, glowing malevolent red eyes, and ancient corroded armor. The skeletal hand grips a weathered longsword; armor shows pitting and corrosion. An aura of death appears as dark wisps curling around the figure. The pose conveys trained soldier discipline, as if ready to strike. Render with hyper-real detail, cinematic lighting, and painterly textures showing bone, torn sinew, rusted metal, and the glow in the eyes. Background: solid neutral gray. Framing: tight close-up of the head, shoulders, and upper torso; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures; no other subjects or scenery; ensure no cropping of the head.
