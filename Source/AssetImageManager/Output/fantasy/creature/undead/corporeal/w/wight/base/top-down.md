Bird's-eye top-down view of a single medium undead wight warrior: desiccated flesh clinging to bones, ancient corroded plate armor, glowing malevolent red eyes, sword gripped in a skeletal hand, aura of death visible as dark wisps curling around, martial ready-for-combat posture with torso oriented toward the bottom edge (forward) of the frame, no background elements, isolated on a transparent background for seamless map tile integration, ultra-detailed, high-resolution, no borders, frames, watermarks, signatures, text, or extra subjects.
