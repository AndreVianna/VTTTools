Ultra-detailed, full-body portrait of a corporeal undead wight: a medium undead warrior with desiccated flesh clinging to bones, glowing malevolent red eyes, wearing ancient corroded armor with chipped plates and dark patina. A long ancient sword gripped in a skeletal hand; aura of death radiating as dark wisps curling around the figure. Set in a crypt, graveyard, or haunted ruin—crumbling stone walls, shadowy arches, moss, and cold moonlight or torchlight. The wight moves with trained-soldier precision, stance poised for action. Render with cinematic lighting and high detail, rich textures of bone, torn flesh, rusted metal, and worn leather. Full-body, full-view illustration suitable for a book or display panel. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or extra subjects; no cropping or distortion; no blur.
