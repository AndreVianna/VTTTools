Full-body, high-detail fantasy illustration of a medium undead corporeal zombie. The creature features pallid, decaying flesh with patches of bone showing through torn skin, glazed vacant eyes, and a shambling, relentless gait with outstretched arms. Clothing is torn and decayed, in tatters clinging to a humanoid frame. Set in crypts, graveyards, or haunted ruins—foggy tombs, crumbling arches, moonlit or torchlit ambience. Mood: eerie, somber, chilling, with cold blue-gray light and gentle mist. Style: vivid painterly realism, suitable for a book illustration or display panel. Ensure a clear, full-view presentation of the subject with no border, frame, text, watermark, signature, or cropping; no multiple subjects; anatomically correct; high resolution and crisp details.
