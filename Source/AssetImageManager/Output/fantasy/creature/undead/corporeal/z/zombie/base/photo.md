Close-up, high-detail illustration of a corporeal undead zombie: a medium undead corpse with pallid, rotting flesh, patches where flesh has decayed away to reveal bone and sinewy muscle beneath; glazed vacant eyes; slow shambling gait with arms outstretched; clothing torn and decayed; rendered on a solid neutral gray background; centered, full head and shoulders in frame; no borders, text, watermark, or extra elements; crisp textures and painterly lighting suitable as a token for a tabletop map.
