Top-down bird's-eye view of a single medium undead zombie, full body visible, oriented with its head at the top and its forward gaze toward the bottom of the frame; it shambles with outstretched arms. Features: flesh rotting and falling away, pallid decaying skin with exposed bone and sinew, glazed vacant eyes, torn and decayed clothing; slow, relentless gait. Style: high-detail fantasy token illustration suitable for tabletop maps. Background: transparent for seamless map integration; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or signatures; no other subjects, no scenery or environment elements; crisp lines, rich texture, subtle shading to convey rot, cloth, and bone.
