A vivid full-body portrait illustration of a medium corporeal undead ghoul: a hunched, feral figure with rotting flesh, exposed bone texture, long sharp claws, and a mouth open to reveal pointed teeth; sunken eyes, matted tangled hair, and a tongue lolling obscenely; body smeared with grave dirt and blood, moving with jerky, bestial motions, emitting a palpable sense of decay. Set in crypts, graveyards, or haunted ruins—stone walls, cracked tombs, creeping ivy, dim torchlight, fog and moss in the background. Cinematic, high-detail realism with dramatic lighting; accurate anatomy; full view of the subject; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or cropping; no duplicate subjects.
