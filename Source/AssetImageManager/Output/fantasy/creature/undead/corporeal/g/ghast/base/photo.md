Close-up, hyper-detailed illustration of an Undead Corporeal Ghast: an advanced ghoul, more decayed and powerful. Gray-green rotting flesh hanging from exposed bones with visible bone structure; razor-sharp claws dripping ichor; rows of needle-like teeth; eyes glow with unholy hunger; hunched predatory stance. A foul green miasma surrounds the head and upper torso, visualizing the nauseating stench. Focus on head and shoulders in a close-up portrait. Background: solid neutral background (charcoal gray). Style: dark fantasy realism, ultra-high detail. No borders, frames, text, watermark, signature; no other subjects; no background scenery or environment details.
