Full-body, vivid portrait illustration of an undead corporeal ghast: an advanced ghoul more decayed and powerful, gray-green rotting flesh hanging from exposed bones, razor-sharp claws dripping ichor, rows of needle-like teeth, eyes glowing with unholy hunger, and a nauseating green miasma wafting from its form. The creature is hunched in a predatory stance, radiating predatory intelligence. Set in crypts, graveyards, or haunted ruins—crumbling stone arches, moss-covered tombs, broken gravestones, and a faint sickly-green fog. Lighting should be eerie and dramatic with high contrast to emphasize the texture of bone and rot. The image must show the full body in frame, with no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or signatures; in a painterly fantasy realism style with vivid colors and meticulous detail.
