Bird's-eye top-down view of a single medium corporeal undead ghoul, hunched feral posture with claws extended, mouth open to reveal pointed teeth, rotting flesh mottled with grave dirt and blood, sunken eyes, matted hair; implied jerky, bestial motion; oriented toward the bottom edge of the frame as if looking forward and moving forward; plain transparent background suitable for a map token; high detail, crisp lines, no border, watermark, text, or additional elements.
