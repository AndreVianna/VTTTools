Top-down bird's-eye view of a single full-body undead corporeal ghast on a transparent game tile, looking forward along its body axis (not toward the camera). Advanced ghoul: more decayed than a ghoul, gray-green rotting flesh hanging from exposed bones, a hunched predatory stance, razor-sharp claws, and rows of needle-like teeth. Eyes glow with unholy hunger. A nauseating stench is visible as green miasma wafting from its flesh. Paralytic claws dripping ichor; green fog of stench surrounding the creature. Crisp, high-detail fantasy illustration, tile-ready, seamless integration for a tabletop map. No border, frame, text, watermark, signature; no background elements, scenery, or other subjects; no cropping or partial body; transparent background.
