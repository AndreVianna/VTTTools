Ultra-detailed close-up portrait of a Nothic Aberration: a four-foot-tall cursed mage transformed into a hunched, gaunt monstrosity. One massive cyclopean eye dominates the face, gleaming with corrupt intelligence. Emaciated gray-green mottled skin stretched over a gaunt skull. Long, spindly clawed fingers extend into the frame. Wide mouth filled with needle-like teeth. The creature crouches in shadow. Render on a solid neutral background (cool gray) to emphasize features. Head and upper torso fully in frame, no borders or text, single subject.
