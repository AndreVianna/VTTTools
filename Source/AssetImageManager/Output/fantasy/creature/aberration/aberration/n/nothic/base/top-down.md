Bird's-eye top-down view of a single Aberration Nothic: a four-foot-tall, emaciated, hunched mage transformed into a grotesque creature, shuffling in a crouch. Mottled gray-green diseased skin stretched over the frame; long spindly claws; wide mouth filled with needle teeth. A single massive cyclopean eye dominates the face, gleaming with corrupt intelligence; head angled slightly so the eye is visible from above along the forward axis, not directly facing the camera. The figure is crouched in shadows. Transparent background for seamless tabletop map integration; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or background scenery; ultra-detailed, crisp, high-quality render; single subject, no duplicates.
