Ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a Nothic Aberration: a cursed mage transformed into a hunched, emaciated four-foot-tall creature, shuffling in a crouch. Mottled gray-green, diseased skin stretched over bone and sinew; long spindly fingers tipped with sharp curved claws. The face is dominated by a single massive cyclopean eye that gleams with corrupt intelligence. A wide mouth filled with needle-like teeth sits beneath the eye. The figure is half in shadow, in an Underdark cavern with stalactites and faint bioluminescent fungi. The setting hints at the Far Realms: subtle, impossible geometry and an otherworldly aura in the background, with cold blue-green lighting.
