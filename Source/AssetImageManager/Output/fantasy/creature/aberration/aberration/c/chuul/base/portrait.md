An 8-foot-tall Aberration Chuul, a horrifying crustacean-like aberration, standing in an UnderDark pool. Full-body, front-facing portrait: two massive lobster-like claws raised in a threatening arc; six muscular, segmented legs splayed in the water; a thick, armored carapace glistening with wet slime; around its maw a cluster of writhing tentacles; the damp flesh and shell dripping water and slime. It can sense magic, so its carapace and eye stalks glow faintly with arcane energy, and faint runes trace across the shell. The environment is a dim cavern of the UnderDark, with stalactites, a murky pool, and bioluminescent fungi casting eerie green-blue light; subtle Far Realms influence appears as purple wisps and distant star-motes in the air. Dramatic lighting emphasizes texture and wet surfaces; color palette includes deep blues, greens, and purples; hyper-detailed, painterly fantasy illustration. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other subjects; the entire creature is visible with no cropping.
