Top-down bird's-eye view of an Aberration Chuul, 8 feet tall, in shallow water with a front-directed posture toward the forward edge of the map tile. Two massive lobster-like claws raised, six segmented legs splayed in water. A cluster of writhing tentacles surrounds its mouth. Thick armored shell glistening wet, segmented armor plates, body dripping slime and water. Amphibious creature with arcane-sense aura around its carapace, hinting at magic-detection. Water ripples around the creature. Seamless tile-ready illustration for a fantasy tabletop map. No borders, frame, text, watermark, signatures, or extra subjects. No background scenery or environment details beyond the water, high detail and crisp texture.
