Close-up, token-ready digital painting of an Aberration Chuul. A towering 8-foot-tall crustacean-like horror shown from head to mid-torso with its two massive lobster-like claws raised, six legs splayed at the base on a glossy, wet surface. The segmented armored shell is glistening wet, coated in slime and water droplets. A cluster of writhing tentacles surrounds the mouth, giving a menacing, otherworldly look. The creature can sense magic; give a subtle arcane glow to the eyes and faint runes along the carapace. Color palette: dark damp greens and blues with metallic rust tones on the claws; wet highlights on the shell. Lighting: dramatic, high-detail, emphasizing texture of chitin, slime, and tentacles with realistic wet reflections. Background: solid neutral backdrop (gray gradient), no scenery or environmental elements. Composition: centered, borderless, no text, watermark, frames, or borders; single subject; no cropping of essential features; no partial heads. Output in ultra-high-resolution fantasy realism suitable for a tabletop token.
