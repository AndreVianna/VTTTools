Bird's-eye top-down view of an Aberration Mouther Gibbering: a 3-4 foot-wide amorphous mass covered with dozens of eyes and mouths that constantly appear and disappear across its wet, pulsating surface. The ground beneath liquefies into a slick, glassy pool that ripples outward as the creature shifts. Eyes and mouths vary in size and color, blinking and gaping in a maddening babble; a chorus of incoherent voices seems to emanate from the surface. The body continually reshapes itself, oozing and reforming in rippling waves. Soft, directional lighting highlights the glossy, bio-organic texture. The front of the mass faces toward the top edge of the frame to imply forward movement while maintaining a true bird's-eye perspective. Render on a flat, neutral tabletop map tile with no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or background scenery.
