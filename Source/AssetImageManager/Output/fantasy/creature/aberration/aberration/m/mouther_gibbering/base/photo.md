Close-up, square aspect, hyper-detailed illustration of a Gibbering Mouther Aberration. A 3-4 ft across amorphous, gelatinous mass, wet and pulsating, with dozens of eyes and mouths embedded across the surface; eyes glassy and blinking at times, mouths varying in size and shape, some with jagged teeth, constantly shifting, appearing and disappearing in a living mosaic. Ground beneath liquefies into a shallow, gleaming pool of viscous fluid that warps light around the base. The body writhes and reforms, no fixed shape, surface slick with mucous, subtle membranes and ridges. Palette of cool greens and blues with fleshy pinks and crimson accents. Lighting from above-left to emphasize wet texture. Solid neutral background with no extra objects; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other subjects. High-resolution, ultra-detailed macro-style close-up capturing the main features.
