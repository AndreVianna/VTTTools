Full-view, high-detail fantasy illustration of an Aberration Otyugh in the Underdark, far realms, standing 8 feet tall on three thick legs. Its central body is a bloated mass of diseased flesh, from which two long tentacles emerge, each tentacle tipped with ridges, and a refuse pile at its base from which they extend. Above a massive, gaping maw filled with teeth, three eyes sit on retractable stalks, waving and scanning the gloom. The creature is encrusted with filth and excrement, mucus and grime clinging to every surface. Scene set in a damp Underdark cavern illuminated by pale bioluminescent fungi, cast in eerie green-blue hues with deep shadows. Render textures of rotted flesh, slime, and muck with hyper-detailed realism, ensuring anatomical accuracy: three legs, articulated tentacles, three eyes, and a wide mouth. The artwork should read as a portrait-like full-body shot suitable for a book illustration or display panel, with no borders, text, watermarks, or additional subjects.
