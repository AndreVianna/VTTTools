Bird's-eye top-down view of an Aberration Otyugh, eight feet tall, fully within frame on a plain neutral surface with no background or scenery. A central bloated mass of diseased flesh supports three legs arranged around it. From the mass emerge two long tentacles with ridged tips reaching outward. A large central mouth filled with teeth sits on the front of the mass. Three eyes on retractable stalks rise above the maw, their stalks waving toward the viewer. The creature is covered in filth and waste. High-detail, crisp linework, suitable for seamless integration into a tabletop map; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or extra creatures.
