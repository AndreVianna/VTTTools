Hyper-detailed close-up illustration of an Aberration Otyugh: a bloated central mass of diseased flesh standing about 8 feet tall, with three sturdy legs beneath. Two long tentacles with ridged tips extend from the filth clinging to its body, while three eyes sit on retractable stalks above a massive central maw filled with jagged teeth. The creature is covered in filth and waste. Render against a solid neutral background with no borders, frames, text, or other subjects; emphasize ultra-detailed textures—diseased flesh, slick filth, ridged tentacle tips, and the tooth-filled maw.
