Top-down bird's-eye view of a 20-foot-long Aboleth, ancient eel-like aberration, with slimy blue-green skin; a line of three eyes along the head glowing with psychic power; four long tentacles trailing from the body, mucus dripping from their tips; the creature undulates along its length and radiates an ancient malevolent psychic aura; head oriented toward the forward direction (bottom of frame) so it appears to look forward, not at the viewer; ultra-detailed fantasy illustration for seamless tabletop map integration on a transparent background; no borders, text, watermark, or background scenery.
