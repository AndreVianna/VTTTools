Vivid full-body portrait illustration of an ancient Aboleth, 20 feet long, eel-like with slimy blue-green skin, undulating through dark underwater caverns of the Underdark; three eyes in a straight line along the head, glowing with psychic power; four long tentacles trailing behind, mucus dripping from their tips; the creature radiates psychic energy and ancient evil; water around it shimmers as mucus and eldritch power transform nearby water-breathers into air-breathers; ambient Far Realms influence suggested by distant impossible geometries and subtle glow; moody luminescent lighting with deep greens, blues, and violet eye glow; ultra-detailed textures on slick skin, mucus, and tentacles; perspective slightly from below to emphasize size and menace; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or extra subjects.
