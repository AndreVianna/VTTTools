Ultra-detailed close-up illustration of an ancient Aberration Aboleth: a 20-foot-long eel-like creature with slimy blue-green skin. The head bears three eyes in a straight line, each eye glowing with psychic power. Four long tentacles extend from its body, mucus dripping from their tips. The creature radiates psychic energy and ancient malevolence. Focus on textural detail: slick, mucus-sheened skin, subtle ridges, wet highlights, and luminous eyes. Background is a solid neutral color (no water, no scenery). No border, frame, text, watermark, signature, or cropping; head fully visible and main features centered.
