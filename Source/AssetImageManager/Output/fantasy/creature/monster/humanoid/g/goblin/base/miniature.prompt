Prompt:
Vertical, full-body portrait of a Monster (Humanoid) Goblin. The goblin is small and thin, with green skin that has olive undertones and subtle mottling, visible veins, and a slightly bumpy texture. He sports long, pointed ears and bright yellow eyes with a keen, sly glint. His mouth shows a few sharp teeth in a wary, cunning expression. He wears ragged leather armor: patchwork brown leather plates, frayed edges, cracked straps, and a torn cloth tunic underneath; armor shows wear with scratches, scuffs, and rust-stains from use. He carries a rusty dagger—blade mottled with orange-brown rust, pitted surface, simple iron guard, and a worn leather-wrapped handle—held loosely in his right hand at an angle that suggests readiness. The left hand rests near his hip, clawed fingers visible.

Pose and composition: standing in a natural, slightly three-quarter turn toward the viewer, one foot forward for balance, weight shifted to the back leg to show full body. The dagger points downward or rests at his side, ensuring the blade is visible. The full figure should be in clear view from head to toe, occupying the center of the frame on a vertical canvas suitable for a book illustration or display panel.

Lighting and mood: cinematic, low-key lighting with a warm, amber torch-like key light from the left, creating gentle rim light on the goblin’s silhouette and warm highlights on the leather armor; deep cool shadows on the opposite side to emphasize texture. A dim dungeon or cave backdrop with rough stone walls and subtle dust motes floating in the air to enhance atmosphere, but keep the goblin crisp and in sharp focus.

Style and details: high fantasy illustration with painterly digital brushwork, hyper-detailed skin texture (pores, subtle warts), realistic leather grain, scratches, and rust on metal; vibrant but natural color palette: green skin, brown leather, rusty dagger, and yellow eyes; crisp linework combined with soft painterly shading; final render in high resolution suitable for print (8K-like detail if supported) and a vertical 4:5 or 9:16 aspect ratio. Negative prompts to consider if needed: avoid modern accessories, bright neon colors, or overly cartoony proportions; ensure no extra limbs or unrealistic anatomy.
