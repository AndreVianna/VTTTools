Prompt: A bird's-eye top-down orthographic token of a Monster (Humanoid) Goblin for a fantasy tabletop map. The goblin is small and thin, with bright green skin, elongated pointed ears, and piercing yellow eyes. It wears ragged leather armor—tattered edges, patched panels, visible stitching, and worn buckles—with a weathered, earthy patina on the leather. In its right hand it grips a rusty dagger; the blade is corroded and pitted, with a dark brown patina and a dull, jagged edge, and a cracked leather-wrapped hilt. A frayed leather belt or strap supports a simple sheath at the hip. The scene is designed for map-token usage: direct overhead view (no perspective distortion), crisp silhouette at typical token scale, background transparent for layering on a map. Include a subtle drop shadow around the token and a faint dark outline (1–2 px) to improve readability on varied map backgrounds. Lighting from above-left creates gentle highlights on leather and skin and soft shadows toward the lower-right. Textures should be highly detailed: leather grain, torn fabric, rust textures on the dagger, subtle green mottling and pores on the skin. Color palette: mossy greens and olive for skin; dark brown and ochre for armor; rust-red for the dagger; yellow eyes. Style: high-detail, semi-realistic fantasy illustration suitable for a VTT token. Output: PNG with transparent background, square 1:1 aspect (e.g., 2048x2048 px), optional variant with a thin border for readability.
