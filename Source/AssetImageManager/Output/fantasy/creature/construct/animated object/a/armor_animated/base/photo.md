High-detail close-up illustration of a complete medieval plate armor animated by magic, standing 6 feet tall, frontal full-body view for a tabletop map token. The empty helmet visor glows with a pulsing magical light. The armor appears worn by an invisible warrior, with a sword and shield held in gauntleted hands, moving with mechanical precision. Joints creak and plates clank as it shifts, with visible rivets, engravings, and articulated articulation. Background: solid neutral gray; no borders, text, watermark, frame, scenery, or other elements.
