Bird's-eye top-down view of a complete, empty suit of medieval plate armor standing 6 feet tall, animated by magic, worn by an invisible warrior; the armor is in a ready stance with a sword gripped in the right gauntlet and a shield in the left gauntlet, front of suit oriented toward the bottom of the frame; the helmet visor glows with magical light; joints and plates move with mechanical precision, with subtle motion lines suggesting clanks and creaks as it moves; highly detailed metallic surfaces with clean lighting; isolated on a transparent background for seamless integration into a virtual tabletop map; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or additional figures; no background scenery or environment; single subject.
