Ultra-detailed close-up portrait of a Quasit, a Lesser Fiend: a tiny demon imp about 2 feet tall with green scaly skin, small horns, fangs in a sly fanged grin, and a forked tail lashing. Bat-like wings are folded and faintly visible behind, with a crouched gargoyle-like posture. Frame focuses on head, shoulders, and forelimbs; claws extended; eyes glow bright green with malevolent intelligence. Include a subtle shimmer around the body to hint at shapeshifting. Render in high-detail fantasy style with crisp skin-scale texture, sharp teeth, and gleaming eyes; dramatic lighting. Background: solid neutral gray. Framing ensures the head and features are fully visible, with no borders, text, or other subjects.
