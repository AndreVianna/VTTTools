Bird's-eye top-down view of a Quasit (Lesser Fiend), a tiny demon imp about 2 feet tall, with green scaly skin, small horns, fangs, and a forked tail with bat-like wings. The creature is in a crouched gargoyle-like posture, tail lashing, claws extended, and a fanged grin; its green eyes glow with malice. Gaze directed forward along its forward axis (not toward the camera). Crisp, high-detail textures on scales, wing membranes, and horns; full body visible with no cropping. Designed to fit seamlessly on a 1x1 virtual tabletop map tile. No borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or background scenery; plain transparent background.
