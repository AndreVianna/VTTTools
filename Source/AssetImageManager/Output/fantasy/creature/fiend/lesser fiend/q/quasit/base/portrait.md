Ultra-detailed, full-body portrait of a Quasit (Lesser Fiend), a tiny demon imp about 2 feet tall. Green scaly skin, small curved horns, fangs, and a long forked tail that lashes behind. Bat-like wings folded against its back. The creature is in a crouched gargoyle-like posture, claws extended, fanged grin, and green eyes glowing with malice. A faint aura hints at its shapeshifting nature. Set in the Lower Planes at a summoned location: a sulfurous cavern with jagged obsidian pillars, ash in the air, a glowing ritual circle etched with occult sigils, and a pulsating portal behind it. Lighting is dramatic with green and ember hues, smoky atmosphere, high contrast, emphasizing textures: scaly skin, horn keratin, leathery wings, and sharp claws. Style: vivid, cinematic fantasy illustration with painterly realism and crisp detail. Ensure only this subject is depicted (no other beings), no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or cropped edges; the subject should be fully visible in the frame.
