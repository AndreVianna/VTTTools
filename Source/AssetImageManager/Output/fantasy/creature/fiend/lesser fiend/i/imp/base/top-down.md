Bird's-eye top-down view of a tiny Lesser Fiend imp about 2 feet tall, with leathery red skin, small horns, a barbed tail coiled behind, and folded bat-like wings along its back; it grips a tiny pitchfork in one hand and wears a mischievous evil grin with sharp teeth, eyes gleaming with malice; body oriented to face forward along the map's forward axis so the gaze runs away from the viewer (face not visible in this top-down view); shapeshifter capable of becoming rats, ravens, or spiders; highly detailed skin texture, gloss on eyes, subtle shading; lighting from above-right; transparent background for seamless map integration; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or scenery.
