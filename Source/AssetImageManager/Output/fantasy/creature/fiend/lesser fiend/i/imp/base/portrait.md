Ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a Lesser Fiend Imp. A tiny demon about 2 feet tall with leathery red skin, small curved horns, a barbed tail coiled at the hip, and folded bat-like wings along the back. It grips a tiny pitchfork in one claw, and wears a mischievous evil grin with sharp teeth and gleaming, malice-filled eyes. Textured skin and bone-like horns, crisp features and a sly, dangerous expression. The setting is a summoned lower plane: a dim cavern with cracked basalt floors, glowing ember sigils, and smoky haze, bathed in red-orange lighting. Subtle hints of shapeshifting—shadows or reflections of a rat, raven, and spider around the scene or mirrored in the imp’s gaze—to suggest its power. The subject is shown in a clear full view from a slight three-quarter angle so wings fold neatly and the tail remains visible. Cinematic, painterly fantasy illustration with vivid colors, high detail, and deep atmosphere suitable for a book or display panel.
