Hyper-detailed close-up portrait of a Lesser Fiend Imp: a tiny about 2 feet tall demon with leathery red skin, small curved horns, gleaming malice-filled eyes, and a mischievous grin revealing sharp teeth. It has folded bat-like wings of leathery texture, a barbed tail coiled behind, and it clutches a tiny pitchfork in one claw. The skin shows fine texture with subtle gloss; dramatic lighting to emphasize features. Background is a flat, solid neutral color (e.g., slate gray) with no texture or scenery. Composition centers on the head and upper torso of a single subject; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or extra elements. Shapeshifting into rats, ravens, or spiders is part of its lore but not depicted in this image.
