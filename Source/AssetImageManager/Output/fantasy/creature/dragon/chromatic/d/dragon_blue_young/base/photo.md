Close-up illustration of a young blue chromatic dragon, about 15-20 feet long overall, shown as a head-and-shoulders portrait against a solid neutral gray background. Brilliant azure scales crackle with electricity, with vivid static sparks dancing along the plates. The dragon’s eyes glow electric blue, and its large frilled ears are extended. A single prominent horn sits on the snout, with multiple horns sweeping back along the skull. Lightning arcs between the horns, emphasizing the electric nature of the creature. The dragon is sleek and vain in expression, with a hint of ozone implied by the crackling. The tail is visible, whipping up fine sand particles around the base to suggest motion. Ultra-detailed, high-resolution fantasy illustration with crisp linework and dramatic lighting. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other subjects; no scenery or environmental elements in the background.
