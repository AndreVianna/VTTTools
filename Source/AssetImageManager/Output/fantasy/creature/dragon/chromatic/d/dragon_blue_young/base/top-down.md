Bird's-eye top-down view of a single young blue chromatic dragon, 15-20 feet long, oriented with its head toward the forward/top edge of the frame so it appears to look forward along its body axis (not toward the viewer), designed for seamless map integration on a transparent background. The dragon has brilliant azure scales crackling with electricity, large frilled ears extended, a single prominent horn on its snout, and multiple horns sweeping back from the skull. Its eyes glow electric blue, with an ozone-like aura implied by crackling energy. The dragon is sleek and vain in bearing. Electric blue scales crackle with static; tail lashes, kicking up sand as lightning arcs between the horns. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or additional subjects; no background scenery.
