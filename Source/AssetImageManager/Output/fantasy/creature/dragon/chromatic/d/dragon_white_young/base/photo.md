Close-up, ultra-detailed fantasy illustration of a young white chromatic dragon, 15-20 feet long. Scales like glacial ice, ranging from pure white to pale blue, with a streamlined body adapted for snow and ice. Head and neck in close view with backward-sweeping horns, wings folded against the body. Eyes glow pale blue. Frost forms on the ground beneath the dragon’s claws. Breath mists in the warm air. Savage, bestial expression. Render on a solid neutral background, high-resolution, photorealistic texture, crisp micro-details on scales, horn ridges, eye glow, frost, and breath. No border, watermark, text, or other subjects.
