Close-up, high-detail illustration of a young red chromatic dragon, 15-20 feet long, with brilliant crimson scales that shimmer like molten metal. A muscular neck and body with enormous leathery wings spread wide. Head crowned with backward-sweeping horns. Eyes burn like coals; smoke curling from nostrils. Mouth open, exposing rows of dagger-like teeth. Scales gleam with metallic sheen; texture crisp. Claws grip treasure coins scattered beneath. Solid neutral background (plain gray) with no scenery. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other subjects. Full head and upper body fully in frame; no cropping of head or edges. Single subject only; suitable as a token for a tabletop map.
