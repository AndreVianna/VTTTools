A vivid, full-body portrait illustration of a young green chromatic dragon, 15-20 feet long, with emerald scales that blend seamlessly with the forest canopy. The dragon features a crest of crown-like horns running from its snout to the back of its neck, plus multiple curved horns along the jaw and neck, and a long sinuous body that coils through a lush forest/jungle. Its eyes gleam with cruel intelligence, and acid drool beads from its fangs. It is poised in ambush among towering trees, mossy trunks, and tangled vines, with dappled sunlight filtering through leaves to illuminate its scales. The entire length from snout to tail is visible in the frame, in a dynamic, calculating pose that conveys mastery and scheming. Rich forest greens, moss, and foliage surround the dragon, rendered in high-detail, painterly style. No borders, text, or watermark.
