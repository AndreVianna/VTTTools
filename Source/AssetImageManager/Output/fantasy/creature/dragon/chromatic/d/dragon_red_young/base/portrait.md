Ultra-detailed full-view portrait-style illustration of a young red chromatic dragon, 15-20 feet long, with brilliant crimson scales that gleam like molten metal. The dragon has a powerful muscular body, a long arched neck, and enormous leathery wings spread wide. Its head is crowned with backward-sweeping horns; eyes burn like hot coals; smoke curls from its nostrils. Its mouth is open to reveal rows of dagger-like teeth. Treasure coins glitter beneath its claws. Scene set in volcanic mountains and desert badlands, with jagged lava-lit rock, scorched sands, and heat shimmer in the air. Lighting is dramatic and warm, highlighting the metallic sheen of the scales and the dragon’s arrogant radiance. The dragon stands on a rocky outcrop with wings unfurled, fully visible in the frame. No border, frame, text, watermark, signature, or cropped edges; single subject; high-resolution, painterly detail, vivid colors.
