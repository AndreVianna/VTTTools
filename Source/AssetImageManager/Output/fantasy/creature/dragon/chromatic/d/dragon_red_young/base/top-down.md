Top-down bird's-eye view of a young chromatic red dragon, 15-20 feet long, brilliant crimson scales gleaming like molten metal, muscular body, long neck, head crowned with backward-swept horns, enormous leathery wings spread wide, eyes burning like coals, smoke curling from nostrils, mouth open revealing rows of dagger-like teeth; treasure coins scattered beneath its claws on a plain neutral surface. The dragon's gaze is forward along its body toward the bottom edge of the frame (not toward the viewer). Ensure only one subject, no other creatures, no background scenery or environmental details, no borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or cropping. High-detail fantasy illustration, suitable for seamless tabletop map insertion.
