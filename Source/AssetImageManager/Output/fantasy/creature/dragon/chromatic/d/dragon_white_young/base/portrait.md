Ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a young white Chromatic Dragon, 15-20 feet long, scales like glacial ice ranging from pure white to pale blue; streamlined, snow-adapted body with backward-sweeping horns; eyes glow pale blue; wings folded against the body; stands on frost-covered ground with frost crystals forming beneath; breath misting in the cold air; savage, bestial expression; arctic frozen peaks and crisp icy sky in the backdrop; lighting emphasizes ice translucence and scale texture; no borders, text, watermark, signature, or other subjects; ensure the entire dragon is visible head-to-tail in the frame.
