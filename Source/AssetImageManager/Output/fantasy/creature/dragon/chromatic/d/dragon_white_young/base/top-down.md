Bird's-eye top-down view of a single young white dragon, 15-20 feet long, on an icy plain. White chromatic dragon with scales like glacial ice, pure white with pale blue tint, streamlined body adapted for snow and ice, backward-swept horns, wings folded tightly along the body. Eyes glow pale blue. Breath forms a mist in the cold air. Frost forms on the ground beneath as it moves. Savage and bestial, head oriented toward the forward edge (looking forward along the map), not toward the viewer. Full body in frame. No borders, frames, text, watermark, signatures. No background scenery or environment details beyond a bare ice surface. High-detail, ultra-crisp rendering for tabletop map integration.
