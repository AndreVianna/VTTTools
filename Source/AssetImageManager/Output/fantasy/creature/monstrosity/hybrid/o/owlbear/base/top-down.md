Top-down bird's-eye view of an eight-foot-tall Monstrosity Owlbear, a hybrid of giant owl and bear, standing on a plain neutral surface for seamless integration into a digital tabletop map. Its thick, shaggy bear-like body is densely covered with feathers ranging from yellowish-brown to brownish-black, with plumage bristling in an aggressive display. The owlish head features limpid pupils in large round eyes and red-rimmed eyes, a yellow-to-ivory beak, the beak open in a screech. Bear-like claws extend from massive forelimbs. The eyes are fixed in a predatory stare. Head oriented toward the front edge of the frame, gaze forward. Weight between 1,300 and 1,500 pounds. Render in ultra-detailed, high-resolution style suitable for a tabletop map token; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or background scenery; seamless, edge-to-edge composition.
