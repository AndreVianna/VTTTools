Vertical full-body portrait of a Monstrosity (Hybrid) Owlbear: an eight-foot-tall fusion of giant owl and bear. Thick, shaggy bear-like body covered with interwoven fur and feathers, color ranging from yellowish-brown to brownish-black. Owlish head with large, round, limpid-pupil eyes, red-rimmed, and a yellow-to-ivory beak. Feathers bristling in aggressive display, massive beak open in a screech, bear-like claws extended, owl eyes fixed in a predatory stare. Stands in a dense forest wilderness with dappled sunlight filtering through trees, moss and ferns, a cool, earthy atmosphere. Ultra-detailed, photorealistic fantasy illustration with rich textures: fur, feathers, beak, and claws contrasted against the forest backdrop. Frame-filling composition, no borders, borders, text, watermarks, or multiple subjects.
