Ultra-detailed close-up bust illustration of a Monstrosity (Hybrid) Owlbear, an eight-foot-tall blend of giant owl and bear, shown from the chest up and facing the viewer against a solid neutral background. Thick shaggy bear fur interwoven with yellowish-brown to brownish-black feathers, with feathers bristling aggressively across the shoulders and neck. The owlish head features huge round eyes with red rims and clear, predatory pupils. A massive yellow-to-ivory beak is opened wide in a screech. Bear-like claws extend from the forelimbs, visible in the frame. The creature exudes a feral, predatory stare. Hyper-detailed textures: ruffled feathers, coarse fur, gleaming claws, and a vivid beak. No text, borders, watermarks, or background elements—just a solid neutral background in soft gray. Portrait-style composition, high-resolution digital painting.
