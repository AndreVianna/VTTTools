Bird's-eye top-down view of a Basilisk Monstrosity: a medium eight-legged serpentine reptile with a sinuous body and dull brownish-yellow scales. The eight legs are splayed in a menacing stance along the sides, while the head is raised and oriented forward along the travel axis. Its eyes glow with petrifying power, suggesting a gaze that turns creatures to stone. The creature moves with a slithering, undulating motion. No background elements, borders, text, watermark, signature, or other creatures; transparent background for seamless tabletop map integration; fully contained within frame with no cropping. High-detail fantasy illustration suitable for map tiles.
