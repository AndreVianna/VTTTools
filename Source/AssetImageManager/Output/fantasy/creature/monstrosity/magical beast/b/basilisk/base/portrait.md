Vivid full-body portrait of a Basilisk, a medium monstrosity: an eight-legged reptile with a long, serpentine body covered in dull brownish-yellow scales; head raised, eyes glowing with supernatural petrifying power; eight legs splayed in a menacing stance as the creature slithers with an undulating motion. The scene shows the beast in a dark caverned ruin at the edge of a desolate badlands, with rough rock walls, hanging stalactites, broken columns, and scattered rubble. Nearby stand stone statues of previous victims, weathered and petrified, in various captured poses. Lighting is dramatic and moody, with torches or bioluminescent glow illuminating the savage textures of scales, stone, and ruin, casting an eerie radiance from the Basilisk’s eyes. Ensure a single subject with full visibility—no borders, text, watermark, or cropping of head or limbs.
