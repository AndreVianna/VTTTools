Close-up fantasy illustration of a Basilisk Monstrosity: a medium monstrosity that appears as an eight-legged reptile with a long serpentine body, covered in dull brownish-yellow scales. It moves with a slithering, undulating motion. Eight legs are splayed in a menacing stance along the sides of its body, its head raised to meet its victim's gaze. Its eyes glow with petrifying power, an eerie emerald glow, capable of turning creatures to stone. Nearby, stone statues of previous victims stand and crumble, carved in various poses to imply petrification. The scene is rendered in ultra-detailed painterly fantasy style, focusing on the texture of scales, the glow of the eyes, the sinewy body, and the stone statues. Background: solid neutral gray; close-up crop centered on the basilisk and immediately surrounding statues; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other scenery or environmental details; no other creatures.
