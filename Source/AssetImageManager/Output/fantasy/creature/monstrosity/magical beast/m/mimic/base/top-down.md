Bird's-eye top-down view of a Monstrosity (Magical Beast) Mimic in its true amorphous form beneath a disguised exterior as a treasure chest. The chest's lid is slightly ajar on its forward edge, revealing a row of teeth along the inner rim; surfaces show a transition from wood texture to pale flesh around the opening; pseudopods begin to form from the sides, hinting at the creature's predatory nature; beneath the disguise, rough speckled gray granite-like skin is visible where the wood grain yields to the true form; the mimic retains approximately 15 cubic feet of volume as a shadowy, amorphous mass within the chest; the creature is oriented with its front toward the bottom edge of the frame (forward), so it does not appear to be looking directly at the viewer; yellow-orange eyes glow ominously within the interior of the disguise and the true form; when it attacks, a large gaping maw full of sharp teeth and glistening tentacles erupts from the opening; the image should be high-detail, seamless, map-ready, with a clean, borderless presentation, no text, watermarks, borders, or background scenery; background should be a plain, neutral tabletop surface or transparent, to tile seamlessly on a virtual tabletop map; the style should be crisp and cinematic, with careful attention to texture—wood-to-flesh transitions, granite-like skin, and gleaming teeth and tentacles.
