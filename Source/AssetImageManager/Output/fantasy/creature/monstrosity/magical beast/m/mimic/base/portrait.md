A vivid full-view, high-detail fantasy illustration of a Monstrosity Magical Beast Mimic in a dungeon treasure vault. The subject is disguised as a treasure chest: wooden planks with tarnished brass fittings, edge slightly ajar, revealing a cavernous maw full of serrated teeth and glowing yellow-orange eyes within. From the lid and seams, glistening pseudopods and tentacles begin to form, curling outward. The surface texture along the disguise shifts from wood to living flesh at the edges, hinting at its true amorphous form beneath. In its true mass, rough speckled gray skin resembling granite is visible in cracks and plates, showing the rocky, mineral mass beneath the disguise. The creature retains approximately 15 cubic feet of inner volume. Scene set in a damp dungeon treasure vault within abandoned ruins: rough stone walls, sputtering torches, and piles of gold coins bathed in moody magical light that highlights teeth, eyes, tentacles, and the granite-like skin. The subject is presented full-front, clearly visible, without borders or text.
