Full-view, high-detail digital painting of a Monstrosity (Magical Beast) named Rust: a medium-sized creature resembling a small pony with four insect-like legs and a squat, humped body. Its thick, lumpy hide is yellowish-tan on the belly and rust-red on the back, protected by a bony armor shell. Its tail ends in a double-ended paddle, and two long antennae protrude from its head beneath each eye. The creature's antennae twitch toward metal, its paddle-tail swishes, its insect-like legs scuttle, and its mouthparts extend toward metal objects. Set in underground tunnels, abandoned forges, and scrapyards, with dim torchlight, damp stone walls, rusted scraps, and hanging pipes. Render in a vivid, cinematic style with hyper-detailed textures and natural lighting, suitable for a book illustration or display panel, showing the full subject in frame with no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or cropping.
