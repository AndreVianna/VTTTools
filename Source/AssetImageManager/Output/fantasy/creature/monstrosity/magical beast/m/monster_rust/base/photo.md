Ultra-detailed close-up illustration of a Monstrosity (Magical Beast) called Rust. Medium-sized creature resembles a small pony with four insect-like legs and a squat, humped body. Thick, lumpy hide, yellowish-tan on the belly and rust-red on the back. A bony armor shell covers its torso. Tail ends in a double-ended paddle. Two long antennae protrude from its head under each eye, used to sense and corrode metal. Antennae twitch toward metal, paddle-tail swishes, insect-like legs scuttle, mouth parts extend toward metal objects. Render with a solid neutral background, no scenery, close-up focusing on main features. High-resolution, hyper-detailed textures: armor plates, knobby hide, jointed legs, metallic corrosion on mouthparts. Soft, diffuse lighting to accent textures and shape. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or other elements. Only this creature in frame; single subject; token-ready for tabletop map.
