Monstrosity (Magical Beast) Rust: a medium-sized creature resembling a small pony with four insect-like legs and a squat, humped body. Thick, lumpy hide—yellowish-tan on the belly, rust-red on the back. A bony shell of armor covers its body. Tail ends in a double-ended paddle. Two long antennae protrude from its head under each eye, used to sense and corrode metal. Antennae twitch toward metal; paddle-tail swishes; insect-like legs scuttle; mouthparts extend toward metal objects. Perspective: bird's-eye top-down view, head oriented toward the bottom edge (forward direction) so it appears to look forward, not toward the viewer. No background elements; transparent background; single creature token for tabletop map. High-detail, crisp linework, and painterly shading to emphasize rust colors and armor.
