Close-up, high-detail fantasy illustration of a Grick (Monstrous Magical Beast). A worm-like predator with a six-foot-long gray rubbery body that is coiled, segmented and muscular. The lamprey-like mouth sits at the center, surrounded by four barbed tentacles that writhe around it. The skin is glossy gray with subtle stone-like camouflage patterns to mimic rock, giving the creature a camouflaged appearance. Emphasize the main features: the coiled body, the four writhing tentacles around the mouth, and the stone-like camouflage texture. Background is a solid neutral color to isolate the subject; no borders, text, watermarks, scenery, or extra elements. Suitable for a tabletop map token.
