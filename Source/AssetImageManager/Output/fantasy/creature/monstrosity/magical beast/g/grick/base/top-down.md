Top-down bird's-eye view of a Grick (Monstrous Magical Beast) on a transparent background, oriented so the head and lamprey-like mouth face toward the top of the frame (looking forward along the body). A worm-like, six-foot-long gray rubbery body is coiled and segmented, with muscular ridges along its length. Surrounding the lamprey mouth are four long, barbed tentacles that writhe around the mouth. The creature is camouflaged to stone, displaying mottled gray stone-like coloration and subtle texture with a glossy, rubbery sheen. The four tentacles are clearly visible and dynamic. High-detail, photorealistic fantasy illustration suitable for a tabletop map token, with crisp edges and no borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or background scenery. No other creatures or extraneous elements. Background should be transparent for seamless map integration.
