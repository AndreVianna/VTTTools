Ultra-detailed full-body portrait illustration of an Ettercap, a monstrosity magical beast: grotesque humanoid-spider hybrid, standing 6 feet tall, gray-purple skin stretched over angular, chitinous plates; four muscular arms ending in clawed hands; a spider-like head with multiple dark eyes gleaming; mandibles flanking a too-wide mouth that clicks menacingly. The creature is crouched on a web lattice, weaving silk with its four hands, moving with insectoid jerks as silk threads shimmer in moonlight. Set in a dim forest depths with shadowy woods and distant cave mouths draped in thick webs; moody green-blue lighting, mist, and hanging filaments. Hyper-realistic textures: mottled gray-purple skin, subtle carapace, gleaming eyes, sharp fangs, and delicate silk. Edge-to-edge, borderless composition with the full figure in view, no other subjects, no text or borders, high-resolution cinematic lighting.
