Top-down bird's-eye view of a single Ettercap monstrosity, a grotesque humanoid-spider hybrid about 6 feet tall, with gray-purple skin and a hunched, chitinous body. Four arms end in clawed hands; multiple dark eyes dot a rugged cephalic region; mandibles flank a too-wide mouth. The creature is crouched in a spider-like web, with its clawed hands weaving silk and mandibles clicking, moving with insectoid jerks. The head and forward gaze are oriented toward the top edge of the frame, so it appears to look forward along its forward axis rather than at the viewer. Render in high detail: textured gray-purple skin, intricate spider silk, subtle musculature, soft directional lighting. Background: solid neutral, no scenery or extra elements; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or additional subjects; designed for seamless integration into a virtual tabletop map.
