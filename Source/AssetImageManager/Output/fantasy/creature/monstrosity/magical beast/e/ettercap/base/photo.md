Close-up fantasy illustration of a Monstrosity (Magical Beast) Ettercap: a grotesque humanoid-spider hybrid about 6 feet tall, with gray-purple skin and a chitinous texture. The creature is crouched in a spiderlike, hunched arachnid-humanoid posture, with four arms ending in clawed hands. Show multiple dark eyes gleaming across a face that features mandibles flanking a too-wide mouth that clicks. The hands weave silk, with delicate silk threads trailing between clawed fingers. Convey insectoid jerks and jerky, unnatural movement in the stance. Focus on the main features: head, upper torso, and forearms, against a solid neutral background (soft gray). High-detail, painterly fantasy style suitable for a token on a virtual tabletop map; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, other subjects, or background scenery.
