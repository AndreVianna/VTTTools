Ultra-detailed close-up illustration of a Monstrosity Ankheg (Magical Beast). Focus on the head and forward thorax: massive mandibles dripping acid, gleaming chitinous plates, and multiple eyes reflecting light. Half-burrowed with dirt cascading off the segmented exoskeleton; several sturdy legs hint from the sides. A subtle arc of acid streams from the mandibles. Background: solid neutral color (plain gray/beige) with no texture. Single subject, no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other elements; no cropping; full head and front body visible. High-contrast lighting, razor-sharp macro detail on carapace and droplets.
