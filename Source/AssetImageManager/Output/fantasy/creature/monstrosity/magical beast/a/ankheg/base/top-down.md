Bird's-eye top-down view of a colossal Ankheg monstrosity, a massive burrowing insect, oriented with its head toward the top edge of the frame so it appears to look forward along its forward axis; display a segmented, chitinous exoskeleton with gleaming plates, six sturdy legs radiating from a thick abdomen, and massive mandibles dripping acid; multiple eyes reflect light; half-burrowed in ground with dirt cascading off the armored body and soil clinging to limbs; occasional arcs of acid spray curling forward from the mandibles; earthy browns, obsidian blacks, and subtle greenish tints with metallic sheen on plates; ultra-detailed, high-contrast illustration designed to tile seamlessly on a map tile with a transparent background; borderless, no text, watermark, signature, or other subjects; no background scenery or environment details.
