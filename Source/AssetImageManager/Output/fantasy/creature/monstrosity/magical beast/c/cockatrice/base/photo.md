Close-up illustration of a Cockatrice Monstrosity (Magical Beast): a small creature blending rooster, lizard, and bat features. Focus on the head, wings, and serpentine tail. Rooster head with a bright red comb and bright red wattle; beak open in a challenge. Dull green-brown feathers cover the body. Leathery, bat-like wings spread wide, with visible membranes. A slender serpent tail coils behind in an S-curve, scales detailed. The stance is small but aggressively forward, with a piercing, challenging gaze. Subtle petrification hint: stone-like texture on chest/forearms to imply its touch turns flesh to stone. Solid neutral background. High-detail textures: feather detail, scale texture, and wing membranes. No borders, frames, text, watermark, or other elements; no background scenery.
