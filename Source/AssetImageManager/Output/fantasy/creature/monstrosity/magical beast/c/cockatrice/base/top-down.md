Top-down bird's-eye view of a single cockatrice monstrosity centered on a plain seamless map tile for a tabletop map, facing forward toward the viewer. A small fusion of rooster, lizard, and bat features: rooster head with bright red comb and bright red wattle, beak open in a challenge; dull green-brown feathers across the body; leathery bat-like wings spread wide; serpent tail coiled behind; small, aggressive stance with a forward gaze. Its petrifying touch is implied as a faint aura around the creature. No other subjects, no scenery or background details; full body visible; clean linework and shading suitable for a game token; no borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or cropping.
