Ultra-detailed full-view digital painting of a Cockatrice Monstrosity (magical beast): a small, fearsome fusion of rooster, lizard, and bat. It has a rooster head with a bright red comb, beak open in a challenge, dull green-brown feathers, and a bright red wattle. Leathery bat-like wings are spread wide, and a sinuous serpent tail coils behind it. It stands in a compact, aggressive pose. Its petrifying touch is suggested by a subtle glow at its claws and a hint of stone texture forming on nearby rock. The setting is rocky terrain with ruins and scrubland: crumbling walls, broken columns, jagged rocks, and hardy scrub. Dramatic lighting from a low sun with warm golds and cool shadows enhances textures of feathers, scales, wings, and stone. The composition is a vivid, high-detail portrait in full view with no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or cropping; single subject only, anatomically correct, crisp focus.
