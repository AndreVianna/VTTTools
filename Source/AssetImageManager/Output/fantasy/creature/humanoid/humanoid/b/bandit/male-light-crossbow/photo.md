Chest-up close-up portrait of a male humanoid bandit, 5-6 feet tall, with rough, weathered features, scarred skin, and short stubble. He wears mismatched leather armor under a hooded cloak, and a bandana covers the lower half of his face. A compact light crossbow is drawn across his chest, held in a menacing, ready stance. His armor is decorated with trophies from victims—bone and teeth charms, rivets, and scraps. Render in high-detail fantasy style with rich textures on leather, wood, and metal, dramatic rim lighting against a solid neutral gray background. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other subjects; tight chest-to-head crop ensuring the head and crossbow are fully visible, with no scenery or environmental details.
