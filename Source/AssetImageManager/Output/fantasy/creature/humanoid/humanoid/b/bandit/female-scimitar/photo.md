Close-up high-detail fantasy illustration of a female humanoid bandit. Rough, weathered features with an athletic build around 5-6 feet tall. Wears mismatched, practical leather armor decorated with trophies from past victims, a hooded cloak, and a bandana covering the lower face. Hardened expression with scars, exuding the confidence of an experienced fighter. In a menacing stance, she holds a curved scimitar drawn, blade gleaming. Focus on head and upper torso against a solid neutral background; no scenery or environment. Render with rich textures: leather, metal, and fabric, with dramatic but controlled lighting to highlight eyes, scars, and weapon. No borders, text, watermark, signatures, or extra subjects.
