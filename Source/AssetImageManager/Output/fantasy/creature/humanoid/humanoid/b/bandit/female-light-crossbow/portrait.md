High-detail full-body portrait of a female humanoid bandit, rough-looking with weathered features, standing about 5-6 feet tall. She wears mismatched leather armor accented with trophies from previous victims, a hooded cloak, and a bandana covering the lower half of her face. She holds a light crossbow drawn in a menacing stance, exuding the confidence of an experienced fighter; scars and hardened expression visible. Setting varied backgrounds of forest roads, mountain passes, or ruins with dramatic, moody lighting. Rich textures: cracked leather, metal buckles, worn cloth, wood of the crossbow. Palette: earthy browns, greens, and muted metallics. Centered, full view, no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or cropped edges; no blur, no distortion, accurate anatomy, crisp detail, suitable for a book illustration or display panel.
