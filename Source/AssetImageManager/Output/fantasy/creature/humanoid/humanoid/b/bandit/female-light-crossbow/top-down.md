Bird's-eye top-down view of a female humanoid bandit, full body, 5-6 feet tall, facing forward along the map's forward axis with her face obscured by a hood and bandana. Wears mismatched leather armor—ragged, weathered brown and black plates—adorned with trophies from previous victims clipped to shoulders and belt. A dark hooded cloak drapes over her form. She holds a light crossbow drawn in a ready, menacing stance. Pose conveys confidence and threat, weight balanced, ready to spring. From above, emphasize leather texture, rivets, straps, and metal fittings; earthy browns, blacks, and muted metallics. Lighting soft and directional to highlight weathered armor and weapon. Background: transparent for seamless tabletop-map integration; no borders, frames, text, watermark, scenery, other figures, or cropped edges; ensure full-body visibility.
