Full-body, ultra-detailed fantasy portrait of a female humanoid bandit, 5'6\"-5'7\" tall, with rough features, weathered skin, and a scar along her cheek, exuding the hardened confidence of a seasoned fighter. She wears mismatched leather armor patched with scraps and decorated with trophies from previous victims, a hooded cloak, and a bandana covering the lower half of her face while her eyes remain visible. She stands in a menacing, ready stance with a curved scimitar drawn in her right hand (left hand near her belt). The setting blends a forest road, a rugged mountain pass, and ruined stone structures—dappled sunlight through pines, mossy rocks, and crumbling arches in the distance. Rich textures: leather grain, metal buckles, bone-like trophies, fabric folds, and the gleam of steel. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or cropping; single subject, full view only.
