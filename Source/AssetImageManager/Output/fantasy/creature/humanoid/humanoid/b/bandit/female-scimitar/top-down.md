Bird's-eye top-down view of a female humanoid bandit, rough-wrought features and weathered look, 5-6 feet tall, wearing mismatched leather armor and a hooded cloak, bandana covering the face, trophies from previous victims adorning the armor, standing in a menacing stance with a drawn scimitar held ready at hip level. Full body visible, detailed textures of worn leather, scars, and fabric. She is oriented toward the forward/top edge of the frame, looking forward along the map (not toward the viewer). Transparent background for seamless VTT integration; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures; no background scenery or environment details; single subject only; high-detail fantasy illustration.
