Bird's-eye top-down view of a single male humanoid bandit, 5-6 feet tall, facing forward along the map's axis but with hood and bandana obscuring the face so no facial features are visible. Wears mismatched leather armor and a hooded cloak; trophies from previous victims adorn the armor. He stands in a menacing pose with a light crossbow drawn and held ready, angled diagonally across his torso. Weathered skin textures on exposed areas hint at rugged features. High-detail fantasy illustration suitable for tabletop tokens. Plain transparent background; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or scenery.
