Close-up, highly detailed illustration of a male humanoid bandit, 5-6 feet tall, with weathered features, scarred face, hardened expression, and the confident bearing of an experienced fighter. He wears mismatched leather armor and a hooded cloak, with a bandana covering his lower face. His armour bears trophies from previous victims, subtly integrated into the leather. He holds a curved scimitar drawn in a menacing stance, blade angled across his chest. The background is a solid neutral color; no border, frame, watermark, text, or other elements; focus strictly on the subject.
