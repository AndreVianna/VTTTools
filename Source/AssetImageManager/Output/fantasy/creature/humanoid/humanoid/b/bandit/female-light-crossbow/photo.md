Close-up illustration of a female humanoid bandit, about 5-6 feet tall, with weathered, scarred features and a hardened, confident expression. She wears mismatched leather armor patched with trophies from previous victims, under a hooded cloak. A bandana covers the lower half of her face, leaving sharp eyes visible. She stands in a menacing stance with a light crossbow drawn across her chest, ready to fire. The armor shows rough patches, stitching, rivets, and visible trophies attached. Solid neutral background (plain gray) for a clean token image. Focus on head, neck, and upper torso; no borders, text, watermarks, or background scenery; high detail with cinematic lighting.
