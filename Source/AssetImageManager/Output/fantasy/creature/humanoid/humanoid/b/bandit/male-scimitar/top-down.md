Bird's-eye top-down illustration of a male humanoid bandit, 5–6 feet tall, seen from above and oriented along the map's forward axis with a forward gaze implied by body alignment. The figure stands in a menacing stance, right hand gripping a drawn curved scimitar. He wears mismatched, worn leather armor—patchwork cuirass, bracers, and greaves—adorned with trophies from previous victims (teeth, bones, ritual charms) strapped to belts and armor. A tattered hooded cloak drapes over broad shoulders; a bandana covers the lower face, leaving weathered, scarred features hinted beneath. The overall look conveys an experienced, confident fighter. Background must be transparent (no scenery, borders, text, watermarks, or other elements).
