Ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a male humanoid bandit, 5 to 6 feet tall, weathered rough features, scarred rugged face, exudes battle-hardened confidence. Wears mismatched leather armor layered with scavenged pieces; belts and straps hold trophies from previous victims (teeth, talismans, small trinkets) as grim adornments. Over armor, a dark hooded cloak; a bandana covers the lower half of his face. Menacing stance with a light crossbow drawn and ready, one foot slightly forward, stance balanced and alert. Setting: a forest road that winds toward rugged mountain passes with distant ruins peeking through mist; dappled sunlight filters through trees, moody atmosphere. Textures: cracked leather, metallic buckles, weathered skin, fabric folds. Style: dark fantasy realism with cinematic lighting, painterly detail, vivid colors. Full-body view, no borders, frames, text, watermark, signature; no extra subjects; no cropping.
