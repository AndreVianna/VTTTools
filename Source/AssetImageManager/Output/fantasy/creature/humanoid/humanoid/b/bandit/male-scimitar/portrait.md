Full-body, vivid fantasy illustration of a tall, rough-looking male humanoid bandit (5-6 feet) with weathered features, scarred face, and the hardened expression of an experienced fighter. He wears mismatched, practical leather armor decorated with trophies from previous victims, and a hooded cloak with a bandana covering the lower half of his face. He stands in a menacing stance, drawn scimitar in hand. The scene blends forest roads, rugged mountain passes, and distant ruins with mossy stones and broken arches in the background. Emphasize gritty textures—leather, fur, metal, cloth, skin—and cinematic lighting with high contrast and rich color. Style: high-detail fantasy illustration, hyper-detailed anatomy, full view, no borders or text.
