Full-length, ultra-detailed fantasy illustration of a male humanoid city guard: a disciplined human warrior, 5-6 feet tall, standing at attention in pristine armor. He wears chainmail beneath a tabard in the city’s colors, a steel helmet, and carries a shield in his left hand and a spear in his right, held ready. His expression is alert and watchful, with a firm, disciplined posture. Armor textures are hyper-realistic: interlinked chainmail, leather straps, rivets, and subtle weathering. The tabard bears the city insignia. The scene is set at a grand city gate with castle walls and a distant town square, banners fluttering in the background. Foreground subject in sharp focus, background slightly blurred to emphasize the guard. Cinematic lighting with directional sun and rim light, vivid colors, and rich textures. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or cropping; single subject only; accurate anatomy; full-body portrait suitable for a book or display panel.
