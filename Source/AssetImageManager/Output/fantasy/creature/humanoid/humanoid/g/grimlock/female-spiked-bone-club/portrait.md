A full-body, high-detail fantasy portrait of a female Grimlock in the Underdark. The pale gray, eyeless humanoid stands 5–6 feet tall with a muscular build, thick leathery skin covered in ritual scars and dark tribal markings across shoulders, chest, arms, and legs. She is crouched in a listening pose, head tilted slightly as if using echolocation, with smooth eye sockets where eyes would be. In one hand she grips a spiked bone club, carved from dark bone with jagged spikes. The scene is set in deep Underdark caverns—damp rock walls, stalactites and stalagmites, faint bioluminescent fungi and mineral glow casting cool blue-green light with mist and echoing silence. The lighting highlights texture—scar patterns, muscle, leathery skin, and the rough surface of the bone club. A vivid, painterly, hyper-detailed fantasy illustration intended for a standalone display panel or book illustration. No borders, frames, text, watermark, signature; single subject; fully visible, no cropping.
