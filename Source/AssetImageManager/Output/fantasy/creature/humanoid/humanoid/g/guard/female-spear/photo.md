She holds a spear upright in her right hand and has a shield strapped to her left forearm. She has a disciplined, watchful expression. Background: solid neutral color. Style: high realism fantasy, with crisp textures on chainmail, metal, fabric, and leather. No borders, text, watermarks, or scenery.
