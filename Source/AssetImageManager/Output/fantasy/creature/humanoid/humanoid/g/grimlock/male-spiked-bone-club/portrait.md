Full-body, front-view portrait of a male Grimlock in the Underdark. A blind, pale gray humanoid standing 5 to 6 feet tall with a muscular build. Eyeless face with smooth skin where eye sockets should be; thick, leathery skin covered in ritual scars and bold tribal markings across the brow, cheeks, neck, and chest. He is crouched in a listening pose, head tilted slightly to the side as if using echolocation, with nostrils subtly flaring to sense scent. In his right hand he grips a spiked bone club—bone-colored, weathered, with jagged spikes and carved ritual inscriptions along the haft. His left hand rests at his side. The scene is set in a damp, echoing Underdark cavern: jagged rock walls, dripping stalactites, stalagmites, and pools of dark water, illuminated by pale blue-green bioluminescent fungi that cast spectral light. The atmosphere is tense and primal, with dramatic, high-detail lighting revealing skin texture, scar patterns, and the rough surface of the club. The image should be a vivid, high-detail illustration appropriate for a book illustration or display panel, with no borders, frames, text, watermark, or extraneous subjects.
