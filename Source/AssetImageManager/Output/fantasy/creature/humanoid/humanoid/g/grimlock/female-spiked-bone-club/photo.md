Close-up portrait of a female Grimlock humanoid, approx. 5-6 feet tall, muscular build, pale gray thick leathery skin covered in ritual scars and tribal markings. Eyeless with smooth, empty sockets where eyes should be. Head tilted in a listening pose, suggesting echolocation and scent. She grips a spiked bone club in one hand, held near the chest in a ready stance. Solid neutral gray background. High-detail fantasy illustration, ultra-realistic texture, no border, no frame, no text, no watermark.
