Top-down bird's-eye view of a single female Grimlock humanoid, 5-6 feet tall, muscular, eyeless with smooth skin where eyes should be, pale gray thick leathery skin, heavily scarred with ritual scars and tribal markings. She is crouched in a listening pose, head tilted slightly forward as if using echolocation to listen, holding a spiked bone club in one hand while the other hand steadies on the ground. The front of her torso faces toward the bottom edge of the image (forward direction) but the face remains unseen in this top-down view. No clothing or armor; no background elements, scenery, or environment. Transparent background preferred for seamless map integration. High detail with crisp textures on skin, scars, and bone; single subject; no borders, text, watermarks, or other UI elements.
