Top-down bird's-eye view of a single male humanoid guard, 5-6 feet tall, in well-maintained chainmail beneath a tabard in the city’s colors (blue and gold). He wears a steel helmet and stands at attention with a disciplined, watchful expression. He carries a round shield on his left arm and a spear in his right hand, facing forward along his direction. The background is transparent with no scenery or environment details, suitable for seamless tile integration on a tabletop map. High-detail fantasy illustration with crisp lines, textures, and lighting.
