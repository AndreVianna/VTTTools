Ultra-detailed close-up illustration of a male Humanoid Grimlock, approximately 5-6 feet tall, muscular, pale gray thick leathery skin. Eyeless, smooth skin where eye sockets should be, heavily covered in ritual scars and bold tribal markings across the face, neck, and shoulders. The figure is crouched in a listening pose, head tilted as if echolocating. In one hand he grips a spiked bone club with jagged spikes clearly visible. Solid neutral background (plain light gray). Composition centers on the head, neck, shoulders, and weapon, with no other subjects, no scenery or environment elements, no borders, text, watermarks, or cropping of the head or torso. Intended as a token image for a virtual tabletop map.
