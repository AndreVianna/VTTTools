Top-down bird's-eye view of a male humanoid Grimlock, 5-6 feet tall, muscular, pale gray thick leathery skin covered in ritual scars and tribal markings; eyeless with smooth skin where eyes should be; crouched in a listening pose with head tilted slightly forward as if echolocating; gripping a spiked bone club in one hand; body oriented so the forward direction points toward the bottom edge of the frame (not toward the viewer); transparent background for seamless tabletop map integration; ultra-detailed, high-resolution render, no borders, frames, text, watermark, or other elements.
