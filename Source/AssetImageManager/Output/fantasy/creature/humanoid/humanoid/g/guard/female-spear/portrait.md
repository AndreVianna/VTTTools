Ultra-detailed full-body fantasy portrait of a female human city guard. A disciplined warrior in pristine chainmail with a tabard bearing the city’s colors, steel helmet, and gauntlets. She stands at attention, about 5'6\" tall, with a shield on her left arm and a spear gripped upright in her right hand. Watchful, alert expression. Scene at a grand city gate with towering castle walls in the background, banners in the city colors, and a hint of a bustling town square beyond. Cinematic lighting, vivid textures on metal, leather, and fabric. Centered, full-body view, no borders or frames, no text, watermark, signature, or cropping. No multiple subjects, no blur, no distortion; correct anatomy and proportions.
