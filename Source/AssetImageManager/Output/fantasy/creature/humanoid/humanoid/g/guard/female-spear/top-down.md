Bird's-eye top-down view of a single female humanoid guard token, standing at attention, 5-6 feet tall, on a transparent background. She wears well-maintained chainmail beneath a city/kingdom tabard, a closed helm, a round shield strapped to her left forearm, and a long spear grasped in her right hand. Posture is military and alert, head oriented along her forward axis (gaze away from the viewer). High-detail rendering: riveted mail, tabard with heraldic colors, leather straps, and metal armor textures. Full-body depiction from above, no background elements, no borders or frames, no text or watermark, single subject, suitable for a VTT map token.
