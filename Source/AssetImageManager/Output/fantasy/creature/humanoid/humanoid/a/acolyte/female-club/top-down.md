Top-down bird's-eye view of a full-body young female humanoid acolyte, 5-6 feet tall, wearing simple, clean priest robes colored to reflect her deity; peaceful, devoted expression, gaze directed forward along the map’s axis but face not visible from above; holy symbol on a chain resting at her chest; in one hand she holds a sacred text and in the other hand she grips a simple club; background transparent for seamless tabletop map integration; no border, frame, watermark, text, or signature; no other subjects or scenery; rendered in high-detail fantasy art style with soft lighting and smooth shading.
