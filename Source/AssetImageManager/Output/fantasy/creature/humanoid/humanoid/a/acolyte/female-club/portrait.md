Full-body fantasy portrait of a young female humanoid acolyte in a temple setting. She stands 5'6\" tall with a calm, devout expression, wearing simple, pristine priest robes in colors of her deity with subtle embroidery and a modest sash. A chain with a holy symbol rests at her chest. In her left arm she cradles a sacred text, while in her right hand she grips a plain wooden club. The background shows a temple/shrine/monastery interior with stone columns, altars, incense, and warm light filtering through stained glass. The scene should be luminous, richly detailed, and painterly, with textures of fabric, metal, wood, and stone. Ensure a full view from head to toe, no borders or frames, no text or watermarks, and no other subjects or cropped features.
