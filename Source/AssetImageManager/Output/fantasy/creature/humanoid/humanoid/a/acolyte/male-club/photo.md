Close-up portrait of a young adult male humanoid acolyte, 5–6 feet tall, wearing simple, clean priest robes colored to reflect his deity (e.g., deep blue with silver trim). Peaceful, devout expression and humble bearing. He wears a holy symbol on a chain around his neck, carries a sacred text, and grips a plain wooden club in his other hand. High-detail fantasy illustration focused on head, neck, and upper torso, against a solid neutral background suitable for a tabletop token. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or other subjects; no scenery or background elements; head fully visible; crisp lighting and sharp focus on facial features and sacred items.
