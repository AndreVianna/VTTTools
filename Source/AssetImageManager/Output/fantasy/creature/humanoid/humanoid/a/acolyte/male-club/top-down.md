Bird's-eye top-down view of a young male humanoid acolyte, standing 5-6 feet tall, looking forward along his body's forward axis (not toward the camera). He wears simple, clean priest robes in colors reflecting his deity (e.g., pale robes with subtle gold trim). His expression is peaceful and devout. A holy symbol on a chain rests around his neck. He carries a sacred text under one arm and grips a plain wooden club in the other hand. The pose conveys humble reverence. Plain neutral backdrop with no scenery, environment, or landscape details. High-detail fantasy illustration with crisp linework and texture, suitable for seamless integration into a tabletop map. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or signatures; full-body, not cropped; single subject; no looking up.
