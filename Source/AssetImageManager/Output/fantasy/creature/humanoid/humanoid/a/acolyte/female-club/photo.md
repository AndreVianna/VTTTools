Close-up torso portrait of a young female humanoid acolyte in simple, clean priest robes colored to reflect her deity, standing 5-6 feet tall. She has a peaceful, devoted expression. A holy symbol hangs on a chain at her chest, and she holds a sacred text in one hand while gripping a simple wooden club in the other. The image should focus on the face, hands, robes, symbol, book, and club, with crisp detail. Background: solid neutral color, no scenery. Fantasy illustration, high realism, soft lighting, no borders, watermarks, or text.
