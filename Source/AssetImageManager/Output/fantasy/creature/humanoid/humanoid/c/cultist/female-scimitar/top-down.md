Bird's-eye top-down view of a female humanoid cultist, oriented to face forward along the map's axis, seen from above with a hood partially concealing her face. She wears dark ritual robes covered in sinister cult symbols painted in blood; the robes are tattered and stained. Her intense zealous expression and wild eyes are hinted beneath the hood. She grips a ceremonial dagger in one hand and a curved scimitar in the other, arms held in a twitchy, nervous pose as if ready to strike. Rich textures on heavy fabric, blood-stained sigils, and gleaming metal blades; lighting from above to emphasize folds and edges. Background must be transparent for seamless map integration; no borders, frames, text, watermark, scenery, or environment details; single subject only.
