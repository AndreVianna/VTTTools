Create a vivid full-body portrait of a female humanoid cultist, fanatical and relentless, wearing dark ritual robes adorned with sinister cult symbols. Hood partially conceals her face, but wild, intense eyes and a zealous, feverish expression are visible. Robes are tattered and stained, with unholy symbols painted in blood along the hems and chest. She moves with twitchy, nervous energy. In one hand she holds a ceremonial dagger; in the other she grips a gleaming curved scimitar. Scene set in a hidden temple ruin within a dark forest and abandoned ruins, with mossy stones, crumbling pillars, and flickering torches. Lighting is moody, a mix of moonlight and firelight, with rich textures on fabric, metal, leather, and symbols. Single subject, anatomically correct, full view, no borders, watermarks, text, or signatures, no cropping of head or face.
