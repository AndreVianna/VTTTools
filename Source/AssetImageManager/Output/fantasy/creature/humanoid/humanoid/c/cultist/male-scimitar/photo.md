Close-up portrait of a male humanoid cultist, fanatical and intense with wild, fevered eyes and nervous, twitchy energy. Dressed in dark ritual robes that are tattered and stained, bearing sinister cult symbols and blood-red sigils painted across the fabric. Hood partially conceals the face, revealing piercing eyes and a fervent expression. He holds a ceremonial dagger in one hand and a curved scimitar in the other, posed in a threatening, twitchy stance. Solid neutral gray background. Hyper-detailed fantasy illustration with dramatic lighting, ultra-high resolution.
