Close-up fantasy portrait of a female humanoid cultist: a fanatic, zealous expression with wild eyes, wearing hooded dark ritual robes adorned with sinister cult symbols, symbols painted in dark red blood along the robes; robes are tattered and stained; pale skin; hood partially concealing her face; she radiates nervous, twitchy energy; she holds a ceremonial dagger in one hand and a curved scimitar in the other, blades gleaming, weapons crossed in front of her chest; background is a solid neutral gray; high-detail fantasy illustration; no borders or frames, no text, watermark, signatures; no other subjects or background scenery.
