Ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a male humanoid cultist: a fanatical human in dark ritual robes etched with sinister cult symbols. The robes are tattered and stained, with unholy symbols painted in blood along the hems and cuffs. A hood partially conceals his face, revealing intense, wild eyes and a zealous glare. He stands with nervous, twitchy energy, gripping a ceremonial dagger in one hand and a curved scimitar in the other. Set against a moody fantasy backdrop of hidden temples, dark forests, and abandoned ruins—crumbling pillars, shadowed trees, and misty air. Dramatic lighting and rich textures—crisp fabrics, leather, and metal—rendered with high-detail and cinematic chiaroscuro. Full-body view with correct anatomy, borderless composition, no text, watermarks, frames, or multiple subjects.
