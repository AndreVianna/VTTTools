Bird's-eye top-down view of a male humanoid cultist, fully visible from head to toe, oriented to face forward along the frame, on a transparent background for tabletop map use. He wears dark ritual robes with sinister cult symbols, hood partially concealing his face, and wild eyes with a fanatical, intense expression. The robes are tattered and stained with crimson symbols painted in blood. He grips a ceremonial dagger in one hand and a curved scimitar in the other. His posture and motion convey nervous, twitchy energy, with robes fluttering slightly. No border, text, watermark, or background elements.
