Bird's-eye top-down view of a female goblinoid bugbear, 7 feet tall, muscular build, coarse yellow-brown to greenish-brown fur, broad shoulders, long arms; wearing dark leather and furs; in a stealthy crouched stance; clutching a massive morningstar in one hand and holding a long javelin in the other. The face blends ursine and goblinoid traits with sharp teeth and keen senses, though viewed from above in a top-down perspective with the gaze forward along her body axis. Ultra-detailed fur, leather, fur textures, and metallic morningstar details; dramatic lighting. Background transparent or neutral for a crisp tabletop map token; no scenery, environment details, borders, frames, watermarks, text, signatures. Full-body view, no cropping, single subject, clean edges.
