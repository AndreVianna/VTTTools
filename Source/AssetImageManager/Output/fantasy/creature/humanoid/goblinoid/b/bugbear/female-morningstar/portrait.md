Full-body, high-detail fantasy illustration of a female bugbear (goblinoid). She stands 7 feet tall with a powerful, muscular build, covered in coarse yellow-brown to greenish-brown fur, broad shoulders, and long arms. Her face blends ursine and goblinoid features with sharp teeth and keen, alert eyes. She wears dark leather armor and fur, in a stealthy crouched stance, gripping a massive morningstar with both hands. The setting is a wild forest wilderness with filtered sunlight, ferns, moss, and fallen logs. The image should be vivid, anatomically correct, and suitable for a book or display panel, showing the full subject without borders, frames, text, watermarks, cropping, or multiple subjects.
