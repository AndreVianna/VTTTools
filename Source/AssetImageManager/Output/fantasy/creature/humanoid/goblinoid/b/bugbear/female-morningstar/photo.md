Close-up, bust-length portrait of a female bugbear (goblinoid) towering at 7 feet with a powerful muscular build, coarse yellow-brown to greenish-brown fur, broad shoulders, and long arms. Her face blends ursine and goblinoid features with a strong jaw, sharp teeth, and keen amber eyes. She wears dark leather armor with fur accents for stealth. In a stealthy crouched stance, she grips a massive spiked morningstar with both hands, held in front of her chest. Solid neutral background (soft gray) with dramatic, moody lighting to highlight fur texture, musculature, and the weathered metal of the weapon. Ensure a single subject, high-detail fantasy illustration with no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or extra background elements.
