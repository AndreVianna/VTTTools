Ultra-detailed full-body fantasy portrait of a male goblinoid bugbear, 7 feet tall, massive muscular build, coarse yellow-brown to greenish-brown fur, broad shoulders, long arms; ursine-goblin face with sharp teeth and keen amber eyes. Wearing dark leather armor with fur accents, designed for stealth. In a stealthy crouched stance, fully visible in the frame, gripping a massive spiked morningstar with both hands. Set in a dense forest wilderness with towering trees, moss, ferns, and dappled sunlight; moody, cinematic lighting. Emphasize textured fur, leather, and metal; high fantasy illustration, painterly, hyper-detailed, vibrant colors, crisp lines, ultra-high resolution. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or cropped edges. No multiple subjects, no distorted anatomy.
