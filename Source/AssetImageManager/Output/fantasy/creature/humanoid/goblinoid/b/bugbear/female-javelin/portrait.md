Full-body, high-detail digital painting of a female goblinoid bugbear, about 7 feet tall in upright proportions, with a powerful muscular build. Coarse fur ranges from yellow-brown to greenish-brown, covering broad shoulders and long arms. Her face blends ursine and goblinoid traits, with sharp teeth and keen eyes. She wears dark leather armor and thick furs, suited for stealth. She is in a stealthy crouched stance within a dense forest wilderness, one massive hand gripping a heavy, spiked morningstar and the other clutching a long javelin. Scene focuses on texture and realism: fur, leather, wood, moss, and dappled sunlight filtering through tall trees. The image should be a vivid, full-view portrait with the entire body visible, no borders or frames, no text, watermarks, signatures, or cropping. High-resolution, cinematic lighting, hyper-detailed textures, natural earthy colors. Proportions accurate, no distortion, no multiple subjects.
