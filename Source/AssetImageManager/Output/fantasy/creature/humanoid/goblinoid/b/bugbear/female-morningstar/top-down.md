Bird's-eye top-down view of a female bugbear goblinoid, approximately 7 feet tall with a powerful muscular build. Coarse yellow-brown to greenish-brown fur, ursine-goblinoid facial features with sharp teeth and keen senses. Wears dark leather and furs, in a stealthy crouched stance, clutching a massive morningstar with both hands; morningstar oversized with a heavy, spiked head and worn leather-wrapped handle. Pose oriented to face forward along the body's forward axis, gaze directed forward, not toward the viewer, as seen from directly above. Background transparent for seamless table-top map integration; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or environment details. One subject only, full body in frame, high detail, crisp shading, suitable for a VTT token.
