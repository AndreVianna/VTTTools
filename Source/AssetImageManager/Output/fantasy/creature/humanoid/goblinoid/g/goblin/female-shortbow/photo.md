Close-up, high-detail digital painting of a female goblinoid goblin. A small, green-skinned humanoid 3-4 feet tall with a wiry build, pointed bat-like ears, an oversized angular nose, sharp teeth in a sly grimace, and piercing yellow eyes. She wears ragged leather armor that is torn and weathered, snug to her wiry frame. She is crouched in a sneaky pose, her gnarled hands gripping a shortbow with the string taut, held across her chest and ready to fire. The image focuses on the head, neck, and upper torso against a solid neutral background (flat gray). Lighting is cinematic and high-contrast, emphasizing skin texture, leather, teeth, and eyes. No borders, watermarks, text, or extra elements; no other subjects.
