A vivid full-body portrait of a male goblinoid goblin: 3-4 feet tall, green skin, pointed ears, oversized angular nose, bat-like ears, sharp teeth, and yellow eyes. Wiry build with jerky, furtive movements. Wearing ragged leather armor, crouched in a sneaky posture, gnarled hands gripping a curved scimitar. Set in a moody fantasy scene among caves, ruins, or a dark forest, with dramatic lighting and textured details on skin, armor, and blade. No borders, frames, text, or watermarks. High-detail, painterly illustration suitable for a book display panel.
