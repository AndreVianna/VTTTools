Close-up, high-detail illustration of a male goblinoid goblin. About 3-4 feet tall, green skin, harsh angular facial features, oversized nose, bat-like ears, sharp yellow eyes, and crooked teeth. Wearing ragged leather armor, crouched in a sneaky, jerky posture, gnarled hands clutching a shortbow, ready to draw. Solid neutral background (plain gray); no borders, frames, text, watermark, or other background elements. Stylized as a high-quality fantasy creature token for tabletop maps.
