Full-body, high-detail portrait illustration of a male goblin (goblinoid), 3-4 feet tall, green skin, angular harsh features, oversized nose, bat-like ears, and yellow eyes with sharp teeth visible in a sly grin. Wiry build. Wearing ragged, patched leather armor. Crouching in a sneaky, furtive pose, gnarled fingers gripping a shortbow (bow drawn) with a small quiver at the hip. Scene blends a dim cave, crumbling ruins, and a dark forest edge—stalactites above, mossy stone, broken columns, tangled roots, and shadowy trees in the background. Moody lighting with cool shadows and warm highlights to emphasize skin texture, leather, and weapon details. One subject only, full view, no borders, text, or watermarks.
