Top-down bird's-eye view of a single female goblin (goblinoid), 3-4 feet tall, green skin, sharp angular features, oversized nose, bat-like ears, pointed ears, wiry build, yellow eyes. Wearing ragged leather armor. Crouched in a sneaky pose, gnarled hands gripping a shortbow. The goblin is oriented toward the bottom edge of the frame (forward direction on the map); from directly above only the silhouette and armor are visible, facial details minimized. Transparent background, no border, no text, no watermark, no scenery or environment elements. High detail, seamless for tabletop map integration.
