Ultra-detailed close-up portrait of a male goblinoid goblin: small green-skinned humanoid with pointed, bat-like ears, oversized angular nose, sharp teeth bared in a sly snarl, and piercing yellow eyes. Wiry build, 3-4 feet tall, crouched in a sneaky posture. Wearing ragged leather armor, clutching a curved scimitar with gnarled hands. Three-quarter view of head and upper torso, full face and shoulders in frame, looking slightly to the left. Solid neutral background (plain gray) with no textures, scenery, or extra elements. High-contrast lighting to accentuate skin texture, armor wear, and blade. Token-style illustration suitable for a virtual tabletop map. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or additional subjects.
