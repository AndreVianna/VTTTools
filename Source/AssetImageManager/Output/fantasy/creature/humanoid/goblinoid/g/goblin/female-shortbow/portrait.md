A female goblinoid goblin, 3-4 feet tall, wiry build, green skin, pointed ears with bat-like inner folds, harsh angular facial features, oversized nose, sharp fangs, and yellow eyes. She wears ragged leather armor, patched and frayed, with rough copper buckles. She crouches in a sneaky, furtive pose, muscles tensed, gnarled hands gripping a shortbow in her left hand and a crude dagger at her belt. The scene blends a moody fantasy setting: a damp cave interior with stalactites and moss, a crumbling ruined stone archway overgrown with vines, and dark forest silhouettes beyond, all dimly lit with faint bioluminescent fungus and moonlit glow. Style: ultra-detailed, painterly fantasy illustration, full-body portrait, head-to-toe, cinematic lighting, rich textures and earthy greens and browns.
