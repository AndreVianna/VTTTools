Ultra-detailed close-up portrait of a female goblinoid goblin for a token on a virtual tabletop map: a small, green-skinned humanoid 3-4 feet tall with pointed ears, oversized bat-like ears, harsh angular facial features, an oversized nose, and sharp yellow eyes with a mouth full of sharp teeth. Wiry, lean build. Wearing ragged leather armor, she is crouched in a sneaky, low stance, knees bent, weight ready to move. Her gnarled hands clutch a curved scimitar with a tarnished blade. Solid neutral background with no texture, ensuring a clean, borderless image. Dramatic lighting to emphasize skin, armor, and weapon details. Close-up focusing on head, shoulders, and upper chest for a clear, high-contrast token image. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or environment elements.
