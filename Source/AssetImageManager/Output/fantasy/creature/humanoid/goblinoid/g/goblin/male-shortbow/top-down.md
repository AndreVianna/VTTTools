Bird's-eye top-down view of a male goblinoid goblin, 3-4 feet tall, wiry build, green skin, pointed bat-like ears, oversized angular nose, yellow eyes, sharp teeth; wearing ragged leather armor; crouched sneaky posture; gnarled hands clutching a shortbow held across the chest, ready to draw; head angled forward so gaze follows the forward direction, not toward the viewer; full body visible; transparent background; ultra-detailed fantasy illustration; no borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or environment elements.
