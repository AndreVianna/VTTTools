Full-body, high-detail portrait of a female goblin (goblinoid), small green skin, pointed bat-like ears, oversized angular nose, sharp teeth, and yellow eyes. Wiry, furtive build, about 3-4 feet tall. Wearing ragged leather armor, crouched in a sneaky pose, gnarled hands tightly clutching a curved scimitar. Scene set in a moody fantasy environment: dim cavern walls with jagged rocks, ancient ruined stonework, and dark forest silhouettes in the distance. Lighting is cold moonlight with bioluminescent moss casting greenish highlights on skin, armor, and weapon, emphasizing texture of leather and metal. Ultra-detailed, vivid full-view portrait with no borders or extra figures.
