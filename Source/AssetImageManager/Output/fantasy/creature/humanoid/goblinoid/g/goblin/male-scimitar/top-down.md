Bird's-eye top-down view of a male goblinoid goblin, 3-4 feet tall, green skin, wiry build, pointed ears with bat-like tips, oversized angular nose, sharp teeth, and yellow eyes. Fully visible, in ragged leather armor, crouched in a sneaky pose, gnarled hands gripping a scimitar with the blade catching a subtle gleam. Gaze directed toward the forward edge of the image (not toward the viewer). Render on a plain, borderless neutral surface with no background scenery or environment details. High-detail, seamless for virtual tabletop map integration.
