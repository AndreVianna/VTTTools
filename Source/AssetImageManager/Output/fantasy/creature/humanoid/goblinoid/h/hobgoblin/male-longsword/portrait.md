Full-body, frontal portrait of a male hobgoblin (goblinoid) about six feet tall, reddish-brown to gray skin, broad shoulders, flat face, and stern militaristic bearing; harsh, disciplined features with fierce yellow-to-orange eyes. He wears well-maintained chainmail and stands in a dim cavern that reveals ruined stone arches and a shadowy forest beyond; he grips a polished longsword in a ready guard, blade angled upward with a firm two-handed grip. Cinematic, high-detail fantasy illustration with moody lighting (cool moonlight and warm torch glow), textured skin and mail, mossy stone, and atmospheric shadows. No border, frame, text, watermark, or signature; full-view, sharp, high-resolution, no blur.
