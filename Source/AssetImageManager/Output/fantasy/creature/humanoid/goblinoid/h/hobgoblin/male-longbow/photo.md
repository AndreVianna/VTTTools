Close-up portrait of a male hobgoblin (goblinoid) warrior: about 6 feet tall with broad shoulders, reddish-brown to gray skin, flat harsh face, and a stern militaristic bearing. Fierce yellow to reddish-orange eyes. Wearing well-maintained chainmail that gleams under stark lighting. In a disciplined military stance, holding a longbow in his left hand with the bowstring drawn back slightly, ready to fire. Solid neutral background (plain slate gray). No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or scenery. Focus on head, neck, and upper torso; no other subjects or environment details; high-detail fantasy realism.
