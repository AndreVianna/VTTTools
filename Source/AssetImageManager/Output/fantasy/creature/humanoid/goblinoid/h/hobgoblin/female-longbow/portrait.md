Full-body, high-detail fantasy portrait of a female hobgoblin (goblinoid) warrior, about 6 feet tall, medium humanoid build, reddish-brown to gray skin, stern militaristic bearing, harsh, disciplined features, and piercing yellow-orange eyes. She wears well-maintained chainmail with leather trim, a battle-ready belt, and sturdy boots, standing in a strict military stance with a weapon at the ready. She holds a longbow in one hand, string taut, ready to draw, with a quiver on her back. The setting blends cavernous cave interiors, ruined stone arches, and a dark forest—dim ambient lighting, torchlight or moonlight, deep shadows, rich textures. A vivid, full-view portrait illustration suitable for a book or display panel, with no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or cropping.
