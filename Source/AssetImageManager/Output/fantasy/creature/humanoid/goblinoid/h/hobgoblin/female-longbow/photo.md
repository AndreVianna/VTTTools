Head-and-shoulders portrait of a female hobgoblin (goblinoid) warrior, standing roughly 6 feet tall with broad shoulders, reddish-brown to gray skin, a flat, chastened facial structure, and fierce amber-yellow eyes. Display stern militaristic bearing and disciplined features reflecting a warrior culture. Wearing well-maintained chainmail that gleams softly, with visible riveted rings and subtle armor accents. In a military stance with disciplined posture, weapon at the ready, gripping a longbow firmly in one hand, the bow angled across the chest. Set against a solid neutral background (soft gray), with no borders, text, watermark, cropping, multiple subjects, or environmental scenery. Close-up on head and upper torso, longbow clearly visible in frame.
