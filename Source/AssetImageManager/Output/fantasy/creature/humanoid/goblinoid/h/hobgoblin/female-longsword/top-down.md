Bird's-eye top-down view of a female hobgoblin (goblinoid) humanoid, about 6 feet tall, with reddish-brown to gray skin and a stern militaristic bearing. Broad shoulders, flat harsh features, and eyes in the yellow to reddish-orange range. Wearing well-maintained chainmail that gleams with linked rings. In a disciplined military stance, with a longsword held at the ready in two hands, blade angled forward along the forward direction. The figure is viewed directly from above, facing forward along the map's front, with the head seen from above so facial features are not visible. Transparent background for seamless map integration; no border, frame, text, watermark, or signature; no background elements, scenery, or environmental details; high detail, crisp linework and metallic reflections on chainmail and sword.
