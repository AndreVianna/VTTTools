Ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a male Hobgoblin (goblinoid) with reddish-brown to gray skin, broad shoulders, and a flat, harsh face. He stands about 6 feet tall with a stern, militaristic bearing and fierce yellow to reddish-orange eyes. He wears well-maintained chainmail with polished steel links, a sturdy belt, and practical boots, ready for battle. In a disciplined military stance, he holds a longbow in his left hand, ready at his side, with a quiver of arrows on his back. The setting is a moody blend of caves, ruined stone structures, and dark forests—cavern mouth, crumbling arches, and shadowy pines—lit with dim torches or moonlight to accent the atmosphere. Ensure a single subject centered in the frame, fully visible from head to toe, rendered in vivid, cinematic detail suitable for a book illustration or display panel.
