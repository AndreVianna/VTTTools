A vivid full-body portrait illustration of a female hobgoblin warrior (goblinoid), a medium humanoid about 6 feet tall with reddish-brown to gray skin and a stern, militaristic bearing. She has broad shoulders, a flat, harsh face, and fierce yellow to reddish-orange eyes, embodying a disciplined warrior culture. She wears well-maintained chainmail with leather accents, sturdy boots, and a practical belt. In a military stance with disciplined posture, she holds a longsword in a ready grip, blade angled downward at her side. The scene is a dramatic blend of environments: a dim cavern with rough stone walls, remnants of ruined fortifications, and a dark forest visible beyond through openings. Lighting is cinematic with strong chiaroscuro—torch or moonlight highlighting the chainmail’s sheen, skin tones, and piercing eyes. Full detail, no borders, no text, no watermark, no cropping. Suitable for a book illustration or display panel.
