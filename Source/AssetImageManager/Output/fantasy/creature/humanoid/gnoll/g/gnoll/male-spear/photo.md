Ultra-detailed close-up portrait of a male Gnoll humanoid standing upright. Mangy fur mottled greenish-gray to dull yellow, sloped back, powerful jaws with sharp teeth, wild manic eyes, feral grin. Wearing crude bone and leather armor (bone pauldrons, leather straps). He grips a spear in one hand, spear diagonally across the chest. Hunched, aggressive posture. Composition focuses on head, neck, and upper torso with the spear visible; solid neutral background (plain gray) with no texture. High-resolution fantasy illustration, photorealistic yet painterly. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, or background scenery.
