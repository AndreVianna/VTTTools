Close-up, highly detailed portrait of a male Gnoll humanoid standing upright with a hunched, aggressive stance. Neutral solid background. Mangy fur ranging from greenish-gray to dull yellow, with a sloped back, powerful hyena jaws full of sharp teeth, and wild manic eyes. Wearing crude bone-and-leather armor with bone plates and tattered straps. Gripping a longbow in one hand, the bow held diagonally across the chest with the string visible; wood grain and bone tips clearly detailed. Focus on rugged fur texture, rugged armor, and the weathered bow. No borders, text, watermarks, other subjects, or background scenery.
