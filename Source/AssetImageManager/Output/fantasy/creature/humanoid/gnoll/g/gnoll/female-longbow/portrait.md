Create a highly detailed full-body fantasy illustration of a female gnoll (hyena humanoid) standing upright with a sloped back and aggressive, hunched predator posture. Her mangy fur ranges from greenish-gray to dull yellow, patchy and weathered. She has a powerful hyena jaw with sharp teeth displayed in a wild manic grin and wild, piercing eyes. She wears crude bone and leather armor strapped over her shoulders and chest, weathered and scavenged. In one hand she grips a longbow; a quiver of arrows is slung over her back. The setting is a harsh savannah with tall grasses and a blazing sun, blending into rugged badlands and the ruins of a desert city in the distance. The image should emphasize textures—fur, armor, bone, wood—and dramatic lighting with a cinematic painterly style. Ensure a single subject, no borders or frames, no text, watermark, or cropping; no other figures.
