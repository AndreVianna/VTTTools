Top-down bird's-eye view of a female gnoll humanoid, standing upright with a hunched, aggressive posture, seen from above as it moves forward toward the bottom edge of the frame. Mangy fur ranges from greenish-gray to dull yellow. Sloped back, powerful jaws with sharp teeth, wild manic eyes. Wearing crude bone and leather armor. She holds a longbow in a ready firing position, arrow notched. Full body fully visible, no background elements, transparent background for seamless map integration. High-detail fantasy creature illustration with textured fur, bone armor, and a menacing silhouette; earthy palette and crisp lighting.
