Close-up fantasy illustration of a female Gnoll (hyena humanoid) standing upright as a medium humanoid for a tabletop token. Mangy fur ranges greenish-gray to dull yellow, with a sloped back and a powerful jaw full of sharp teeth. Wild manic eyes and a wild manic grin. Wearing crude bone and leather armor. Gripping a spear in one hand. Posture is hunched and aggressive, shoulders forward. Focus on the head, shoulders, and weapon in high detail, with a solid neutral background. No other subjects, no environment, no border, text, or watermark.
