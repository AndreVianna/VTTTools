Top-down, bird's-eye view of a male Gnoll humanoid standing upright with a hunched, aggressive posture. Mangy fur ranges greenish-gray to dull yellow, with a sloped back, powerful jaw filled with sharp teeth, wild manic eyes. Wearing crude bone and leather armor—bone plates with tattered leather straps. Gripping a long wooden spear with a bone spearhead in one hand, the other arm at the side. Full body visible, oriented so its forward direction points toward the bottom of the frame (looking forward along its path). No background elements; transparent background. Highly detailed digital painting style suitable for a fantasy map token; tileable with seamless edges for map use. No borders, frames, text, watermark, signature; no blur, no cropping; single subject only.
