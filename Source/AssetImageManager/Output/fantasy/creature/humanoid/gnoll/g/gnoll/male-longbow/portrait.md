Create a vivid full-body portrait illustration of a male Gnoll humanoid standing upright. The hyena-like creature has mangy fur ranging from greenish-gray to dull yellow, a sloped back, and a powerful jaw filled with sharp teeth. His wild manic eyes glare with feral intensity as he moves in a distinctive hunched lope. He wears crude bone and leather armor—bone plates and sinew bindings with tattered leather straps across his chest and shoulders. He grips a longbow in one hand, drawn as if ready to fire. The setting is a harsh savannah-badlands desert with distant ruins—cracked earth, sparse grasses, weathered rock formations, and a warm, dramatic sky. The lighting is high-contrast, emphasizing texture on fur, armor, and wood. The image must be a high-resolution, full-view illustration suitable for a book or display panel, with no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, blur, cropping, or multiple subjects.
