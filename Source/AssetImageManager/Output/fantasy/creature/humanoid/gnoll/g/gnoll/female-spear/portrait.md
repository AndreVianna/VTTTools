Full-body, high-detail fantasy illustration of a female Gnoll standing upright with a sloped back and hunched, aggressive lope. Mangy fur ranges from greenish-gray to dull yellow. She has powerful jaws with sharp teeth, wild manic eyes, and a wild manic grin. She wears crude bone and leather armor and grips a spear in one hand. The scene is set in a sunbaked savannah, rugged badlands, and desert ruins, with wind-swept grasses, cracked stone pillars, and distant dunes. Dramatic lighting, rich textures on fur, bone and leather armor, and a vivid, cinematic color palette to create a vivid full-view portrait.
