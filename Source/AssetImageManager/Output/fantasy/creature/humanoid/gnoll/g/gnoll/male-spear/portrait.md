A ultra-detailed full-body digital painting of a male Gnoll (hyena humanoid) standing upright in a fierce, hunched lope. The gnoll has mangy fur ranging from greenish-gray to dull yellow, a sloped back, a powerful jaw filled with sharp teeth, and wild manic eyes. It wears crude bone-and-leather armor strapped across the chest and shoulders and grips a long spear in one clawed hand. The scene places the creature in a harsh fantasy landscape that blends savannahs, badlands, and desert ruins—cracked earth, sparse scrub, distant acacia silhouettes, eroded red rock mesas, and crumbling temple ruins rising from the sand. Lighting is dramatic desert sun with warm tones, deep shadows, and strong depth. The piece should be vivid, high-resolution, suitable for a book illustration or display panel. Ensure no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures; no blur, no cropping, no extra subjects; perfect anatomy and highly detailed fur, armor, and weapon.
