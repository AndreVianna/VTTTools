Frontal, high-detail token portrait of a female orc: a medium-to-large humanoid 6-7 feet tall, grayish-green skin, muscular build with broad shoulders. Distinct features include prominent lower canines, a sloping forehead, and fierce red eyes. Battle-scarred face with visible scars. Wearing spiked hide armor that is rugged and battle-worn. In an aggressive, battle-ready stance, she grips a massive greataxe with both hands, the axe head and haft visible. Solid neutral background with no borders, text, watermarks, or scenery. Close-up showing head and shoulders in frame, not cropped, focusing on main features and textures (skin, scars, armor, weapon) for a clean token-style illustration.
