Vivid full-body portrait illustration of a male Orc humanoid, 6-7 feet tall, medium to large, with grayish-green skin, broad shoulders, and a powerful muscular build. Orc features include prominent lower canines, sloping forehead, and fierce red eyes. He stands in an aggressive, battle-ready stance with brutish, forceful movement. He wears spiked hide armor—weathered dark leather with bone and metal spikes along the shoulders and chest, strapped and rugged. His battle-scarred face bears scratches and scars from many clashes. He grips a long wooden javelin with a sharpened iron head in one hand, the other fist clenched at his side. The setting combines a cavern interior with stalactites and stalagmites, ruined stone arches and broken columns, and a dark forest edge visible beyond the ruins. Moody, dramatic lighting highlights skin texture, scars, armor, and the javelin. High-detail, crisp, no borders, frames, text, watermark, or multiple subjects; full view of the subject.
