Full-body portrait of a female orc, grayish-green skin, 6-7 feet tall, broad shoulders and a powerful muscular build; features include prominent lower canines, sloping forehead, and fierce red eyes. She wears spiked hide armor with bone accents, a battle-scarred face, and an aggressive battle-ready stance, gripping a massive greataxe with both hands. The backdrop blends a dark damp cave, ruined stonework, and a shadowy forest beyond, with dramatic, high-contrast lighting and rich textures on skin, scars, leather, and metal spikes. Ultra-detailed fantasy illustration, vivid colors, single subject, full-view from head to toe for a book or display panel.
