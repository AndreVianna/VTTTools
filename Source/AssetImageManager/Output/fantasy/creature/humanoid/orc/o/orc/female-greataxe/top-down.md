Bird's-eye top-down view of a single female orc, grayish-green skin, 6-7 feet tall, broad shoulders and a powerful build, wearing spiked hide armor, battle-scarred face, and an aggressive battle-ready stance. She grips a greataxe with both hands, body oriented to face forward (toward the bottom of the frame) with a forward gaze, not toward the viewer. For tabletop map use, with a clean transparent background, no borders, no text, no watermark, and no scenery or environment details. Ultra-detailed, high-resolution, realistic textures with dramatic lighting.
