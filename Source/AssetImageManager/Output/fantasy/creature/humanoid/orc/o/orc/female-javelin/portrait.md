Full-body, high-detail fantasy portrait of a female orc, 6-7 feet tall, grayish-green skin, broad shoulders, and a powerful muscular build. She has prominent lower canines, a sloping forehead, and fierce red eyes. Her battle-scarred face shows grit. She wears spiked hide armor—rugged leather with bone/metal spikes on the shoulders and chest. She stands in an aggressive battle-ready pose, gripping a long wooden javelin with a sharpened metal head. The setting is moody and atmospheric: the interior of a cave with stalactites, or ruined stone structures, or the edge of a dark forest, lit by torchlight or moonlight to cast dramatic shadows that emphasize her muscles, scars, and spikes. A single subject, no borders, text, watermarks, or additional characters; ultra-detailed, crisp textures, realistic fantasy style.
