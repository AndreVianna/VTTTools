A hyper-detailed full-body digital painting of a female humanoid reptilian lizardfolk, 6-7 feet tall, muscular build, green or gray shimmering scales, a long powerful tail, clawed hands and feet, an elongated snout filled with sharp teeth, cold vertical-slit eyes and predatory grace. She wears bone and shell ornaments—a carved bone necklace, shell armbands, ritual scars across her scaled hide. She stands in a swampy marsh with a tropical river, mangroves and hanging vines, mist and murky water. She holds a javelin in one hand, ready to strike. Scene is vivid, cinematic lighting, high detail, sharp textures. Full-body portrait, no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other subjects.
