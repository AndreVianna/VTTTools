Full-body, high-detail fantasy illustration of a female reptilian lizardfolk warrior, 6-7 feet tall, muscular humanoid with green-gray scales, a long powerful tail, clawed hands and feet, and an elongated snout filled with sharp teeth. Eyes cold and alien with vertical slit pupils, moving with predatory grace. She wears bone and shell ornaments, has tribal warrior stance, and her scaled hide bears ritual scars. She grips a heavy club carved from bone and timber. Setting: swamps, marshes, tropical rivers—lush, humid, with mist, hanging moss, mangroves, and rippling swamp water reflections. Lighting: dramatic, cinematic, high-contrast. Style: vivid, painterly fantasy illustration, full-view, no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or extra figures.
