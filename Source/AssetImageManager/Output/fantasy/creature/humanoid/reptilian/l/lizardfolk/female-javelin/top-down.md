Bird's-eye top-down view of a female reptilian Lizardfolk, muscular humanoid 6-7 feet tall, green or gray reptilian scales, long powerful tail, clawed hands and feet, elongated snout with sharp teeth, cold alien eyes with vertical slit pupils, moving with predatory grace. Wearing bone and shell ornaments—bone necklaces, shell armbands, ritual scar patterns on scaled hide. Tribal warrior stance, holding a long javelin in one hand, the other clawed, gaze directed forward along the forward axis. Transparent background for seamless map integration; ultra-detailed, high-resolution, crisp lines, no border, watermark, text, or other subjects.
