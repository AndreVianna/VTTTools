Create a vivid, ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a male humanoid reptilian lizardfolk, 6 to 7 feet tall, muscular build, green or gray reptilian scales, a powerful tail curling behind him, clawed hands and feet, and an elongated snout filled with sharp teeth. His eyes are cold and alien with vertical slit pupils, moving with predatory grace. He wears bone and shell ornaments—carved bone necklace, bone bracers, shell decorations on the shoulders—ornate ritual scars across his scaled hide. He grips a heavy club, rough-hewn wood bound with bone and shell inlays. He stands in a swampy marsh at the edge of a tropical river, with murky water, mangroves, thick vegetation, and misty, humid air. Lighting is cinematic with high contrast, rich textures of scales, wood, bone, and shell, in a vivid fantasy style. Ensure no borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or extra subjects; full-body in frame with no cropping.
