Ultra-detailed close-up bust of a male reptilian humanoid Lizardfolk, 6-7 feet tall, muscular, with green or gray reptilian scales, elongated snout filled with sharp teeth, cold vertical slit eyes, moving with predatory grace. Wears bone and shell ornaments; scaled hide decorated with ritual scars. In a tribal warrior stance, gripping a heavy club across the chest with both hands. Solid neutral background (deep charcoal gray). High-resolution, cinematic lighting to emphasize scale texture, scars, and ornaments. Focus on head and upper torso with the club visible; single subject, no borders, text, watermarks, or background scenery.
