Hyper-detailed close-up portrait of a female reptilian lizardfolk warrior: a muscular humanoid standing 6-7 feet tall, covered in green-to-gray scales, elongated snout with sharp teeth, cold alien eyes with vertical slit pupils, moving with predatory grace. She wears bone and shell ornaments (necklaces, shoulder adornments, ceremonial headdress) and her scaled hide bears ritual scars. She stands in a tribal warrior pose, one forearm gripping a spiked shield held slightly in front of her torso, the other hand ready at her side. A portion of her powerful tail curls behind her, within the frame. Background is a solid neutral gray, flat and textureless. Style: ultra-detailed fantasy illustration suitable as a token for a tabletop map. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures; no blur, no cropping; no multiple subjects; no extra background elements or scenery; subject centered with head and shoulders clearly visible.
