Wearing bone and shell ornaments (bone bracelets, shell necklace, carved shell accents) and scaled hide decorated with ritual scars. In a tribal warrior stance, gripping a spiked shield in one hand. Set in swamps, marshes, tropical riverbanks with murky water, mangroves, hanging moss, and reeds; damp, greenish light with sunbeams piercing the mist.
