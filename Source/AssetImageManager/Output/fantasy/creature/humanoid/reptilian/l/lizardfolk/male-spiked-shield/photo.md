Close-up, waist-up portrait of a single male humanoid reptilian Lizardfolk in a tribal warrior stance. 6-7 feet tall, muscular build, green or gray reptilian scales with fine texture and subtle sheen. Elongated snout full of sharp teeth; cold, alien eyes with vertical slit pupils. A powerful tail curves behind him; clawed hands and feet. Adorned with bone and shell ornaments—carved bone necklace, shell charms, bone armbands—and ritual scars across the scaled hide. He grips a spiked shield held in front in a ready pose. Solid neutral background. High detail, high-resolution fantasy creature illustration suitable as a token for a virtual tabletop map.
