Bird's-eye top-down view of a female reptilian lizardfolk warrior, 6-7 feet tall, muscular humanoid with green-gray scales, elongated snout filled with sharp teeth, cold vertical-slit eyes, a powerful long tail, and clawed hands and feet. She wears bone and shell ornaments; scaled hide decorated with ritual scars. In a tribal warrior stance, she holds a spiked shield in front, with her gaze looking forward toward the viewer. No background or scenery; transparent background for seamless map tile integration. High-detail fantasy realism, crisp textures, dynamic lighting.
