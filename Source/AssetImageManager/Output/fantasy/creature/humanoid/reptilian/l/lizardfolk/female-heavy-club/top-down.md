Bird's-eye top-down view of a female reptilian lizardfolk, 6-7 feet tall, muscular humanoid with green or gray scales, long powerful tail, clawed hands and feet, elongated snout filled with sharp teeth, cold alien eyes with vertical slit pupils, gaze directed forward along its body axis, not toward the camera, moving with predatory grace, wearing bone and shell ornaments, scaled hide decorated with ritual scars, standing in a tribal warrior pose and gripping a heavy club with both hands, no background elements, transparent background, no border or watermark, single subject, high detail, seamless for tabletop map integration.
