A single full-body, front-three-quarter portrait of a male humanoid reptilian Lizardfolk, 6 to 7 feet tall, muscular with green or gray hard scales, a long powerful tail, clawed hands and feet, and an elongated snout filled with sharp teeth; eyes cold and alien with vertical slit pupils, moving with predatory grace. He wears bone and shell ornaments—carved bone necklaces, shell armbands, and ritual scar decorations across his scaled hide. He stands in a swampy marsh by a tropical river, with murky water, tangled mangrove roots, lush swamp vegetation, and hanging moss; the scene is suffused with steam and dappled light. He holds a wooden javelin in one hand, ready, the other hand a clawed gesture. A vivid, high-detail fantasy realism illustration with ultra-crisp textures on scales, bone, and shell; dramatic, cinematic lighting, rich colors, and clear full-view composition—no borders, frames, text, or watermarks.
