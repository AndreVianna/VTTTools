Close-up torso-up portrait of a female reptilian Lizardfolk, muscular humanoid 6-7 feet tall, with green-gray scales, elongated snout filled with sharp teeth, and cold alien eyes with vertical slit pupils. She has a long predatory tail curling behind, clawed hands gripping a heavy club. She wears bone and shell ornaments; her scaled hide is decorated with ritual scars. She adopts a tribal warrior stance. Solid neutral background. High-detail lighting to showcase scale texture, ornament details, scars, and the weapon. No borders, frames, text, watermark, or other subjects; no background elements beyond the solid color.
