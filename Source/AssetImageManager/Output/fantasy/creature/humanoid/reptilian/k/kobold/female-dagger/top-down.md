Bird's-eye top-down view of a female kobold (reptilian humanoid) 2-3 feet tall with rust-red to brownish scales, horned head resembling a small dragon, long balancing tail, and bright eyes. The kobold is hunched and scuttling forward, with a nervous tail twitch. She wears crude leather scraps strapped around shoulders and waist, and she is clutching makeshift weapons, holding a dagger in her right hand. The gaze is forward along her path, not toward the viewer. Full body visible in the frame, no background elements; transparent or plain neutral background for map integration. Tile-ready; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, blur, cropping, or multiple subjects.
