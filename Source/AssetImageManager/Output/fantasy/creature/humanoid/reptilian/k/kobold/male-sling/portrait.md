Full-body, front-facing portrait of a male reptilian kobold, 2–3 feet tall, rust-red to brownish scales, horned head like a small dragon, bright eyes, and a long, balancing tail. He is hunched and scuttling, wearing crude leather scraps as patchwork armor, with his tail twitching nervously. In one hand he holds a handmade sling; in the other, a crude wooden club carved from driftwood as a makeshift weapon. The scene is set in a dim cave with ruined stone walls and a dark forest beyond; dramatic lighting with warm amber highlights on the scales against cool shadows, damp textures, moss, and hanging stalactites. A vivid, high-detail fantasy illustration with full-body visibility, no borders or text.
