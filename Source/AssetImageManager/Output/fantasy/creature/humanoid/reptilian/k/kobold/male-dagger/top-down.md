Bird's-eye top-down view of a single male reptilian kobold, 2-3 feet tall, rust-red to brownish scales, horned head resembling a small dragon, long tail for balance, bright eyes, hunched, scuttling posture, wearing crude leather scraps as tattered garb, tail twitching nervously, clutching makeshift weapons, specifically holding a dagger in one hand, oriented to face forward toward the top edge of the frame, transparent background with no scenery or environment details, high-detail texture and shading for a tabletop map token.
