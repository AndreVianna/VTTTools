Close-up illustration of a male reptilian kobold, 2-3 feet tall, rust-red to brownish scales. Horned head resembling a small dragon, bright amber eyes, long tail for balance; hunched, scuttling posture with tail twitching nervously. Wearing crude leather scraps. In one hand he grips a rope sling; in the other he clutches a crude wooden club with a stone tip. Solid neutral background (plain gray or beige). High-detail, cinematic lighting to emphasize scales and leather. Frame focuses on head and upper torso with arms and weapons clearly visible. Single subject only; no borders, text, watermarks, or environment.
