Top-down bird's-eye view of a female reptilian kobold, 2-3 feet tall, rust-red to brownish scales, horned head with small dragon-like horns, bright eyes, long slender tail, hunched scuttling posture, viewed from above looking forward along its forward axis (not facing the viewer). She wears crude leather scraps as tattered garments and clutches makeshift weapons: a sling held in one hand and a crude club in the other; tail twitching nervously. Detailed scale texture, subtle shading, crisp linework, high detail, suitable for seamless integration on a tabletop map. Plain background (transparent preferred), no borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or environment details; single subject; full body in frame; no cropped edges.
