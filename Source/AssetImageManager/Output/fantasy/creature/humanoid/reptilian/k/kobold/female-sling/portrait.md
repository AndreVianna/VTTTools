A full-body, high-detail portrait of a female kobold (humanoid reptile) standing 2-3 feet tall, with rust-red to brownish scales, bright amber eyes, and small dragon-like horns on a hunched head; a long tail for balance; she is depicted in a dim cavern with ruined stone arches and vines, at the edge of a dark forest visible beyond. She wears crude leather scraps as clothing and clutches a makeshift weapon in one hand and a leather sling in the other, tail twitching nervously as if ready to scuttle. The scene emphasizes texture: scales, rough leather, jagged stone, and moss, with moody lighting and warm amber highlights on the scales from torches or bioluminescence. Cinematic, painterly, high-detail fantasy style suitable for a book illustration or display panel, with no borders, text, or additional subjects.
