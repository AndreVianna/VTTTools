Create a vivid, high-resolution full-body portrait of a female kobold — a small reptilian humanoid 2–3 feet tall — standing upright with rust-red to brownish scales, bright eyes, and dragon-like horns atop her head. She has a long balance tail that twitches slightly and a hunched, scuttling gait. She wears crude leather scraps as patchwork armor and clutches a dagger in one hand and a ragged improvised weapon in the other, tail twitching nervously. The scene places her in a dim cave filled with stalactites and ruinous stone, with a dark forest visible through a broken arch and flickering torchlight plus a faint bioluminescent glow. Ensure a single subject in full view, no borders, frames, text, watermark, or cropping; painterly digital fantasy illustration with crisp detail on scales, eyes, and leather, dramatic lighting, and lifelike anatomy.
