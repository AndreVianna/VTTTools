Ultra-detailed close-up portrait of a female reptilian humanoid Kobold, 2-3 feet tall, rust-red to brownish scales, small dragon-like horns, bright amber eyes, short snout; hunched, scuttling posture with a long tail curling behind and twitching; wearing crude leather scraps; holding a dagger in her right hand and a crude makeshift weapon in her left; mouth open in a yipping expression; textured scales with subtle iridescence; solid neutral background (plain gray) for a tabletop token; focus on head and upper torso with a bit of tail in frame; no other subjects, no borders, no text, no environment details.
