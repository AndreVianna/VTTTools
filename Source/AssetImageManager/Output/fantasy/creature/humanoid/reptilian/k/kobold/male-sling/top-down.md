Bird's-eye top-down view of a male reptilian kobold, 2-3 feet tall, rust-red to brownish scales, horned head like a small dragon, long tail for balance, bright eyes, hunched scuttling posture, wearing crude leather scraps, tail twitching nervously, clutching makeshift weapons, holding a sling in one hand, head slightly angled toward the forward edge with forward gaze (not facing the viewer), isolated on transparent background, high-detail textures, no borders frames text watermark signatures, no blur, no cropping, no backgrounds, scenery, or environment elements, suitable for seamless integration into a virtual tabletop map.
