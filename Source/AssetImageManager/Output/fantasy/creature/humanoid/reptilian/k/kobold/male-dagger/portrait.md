Full-body, high-detail portrait of a male reptilian kobold, 2-3 feet tall, rust-red to brownish scales, horned head like a small dragon, bright eyes, long balancing tail, in a hunched, scuttling pose with the tail twitching nervously. Wearing crude leather scraps, clutching a makeshift weapon in one hand and a dagger in the other. Scene combines a dim cave interior with damp stone, stalactites, and ruined arches and broken pillars, with a dark forest visible through a crack in the rock. Dramatic lighting with warm torch glow and deep shadows, rich textures of scales, leather, stone, and moss. Full view, no borders, text, watermark, or blur.
