Ultra-detailed close-up token-style illustration of a female kobold, a small reptilian humanoid 2-3 feet tall, rust-red to brownish scales, horned head resembling a tiny dragon, bright amber eyes, long balancing tail curling behind, hunched scuttling stance; wearing crude leather scraps, clutching improvised weapons, holding a simple sling with stones; tail twitching nervously. Solid neutral gray background. High-resolution fantasy art focused on head, torso, and tail, suitable as a tabletop map token.
