Bird's-eye top-down view of a horse-sized giant arachnid spider facing forward toward the bottom of the frame, bloated body with coarse black hair, eight long segmented legs splayed and ready to strike, crouched on a minimal sticky silk web, eight glowing eyes arranged around the cephalothorax glowing faintly, massive chelicerae dripping venom, silent and eerily precise movements, rendered as a high-detail fantasy creature illustration for seamless token integration on a transparent map surface, no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or scenery; crisp, high-contrast lighting.
