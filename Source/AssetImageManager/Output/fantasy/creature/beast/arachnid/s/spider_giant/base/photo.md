Close-up, ultra-detailed fantasy illustration of a horse-sized giant spider (Arachnid Beast). The bloated body is densely coated in coarse black hair; eight long segmented legs extend outward. A cluster of eight glowing eyes glows faintly in darkness. Massive chelicerae with venom dripping from the fangs. The creature crouches on a nearly invisible sticky silk strand, legs poised to strike. Moody lighting with high contrast to highlight texture of hair, fangs, and venom. Background: solid neutral color (plain charcoal gray) with no scenery or environmental details. The image should be a single-subject close-up suitable as a token for a tabletop map. No borders, frames, text, watermark, or signature.
