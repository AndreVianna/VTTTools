Hyper-detailed full-view digital illustration of a horse-sized giant arachnid spider. The bloated abdomen is covered in coarse black hair; eight long segmented legs spread wide; clusters of eight eyes glow faintly in the dark and massive chelicerae drip venom. The spider crouches on a sticky web stretched between jagged rocks in a rugged mountain-pass and rolling hills, legs poised to strike. Movements are silent and eerily precise. Scene lit by moonlight with cool blue-grey tones, distant jagged peaks, misty valleys, alpine shrubs, and dew-dusted web silk; textures include coarse hair, gleaming fangs, venom droplets, and tangled silk. Perspective: full-body, straight-on, no cropping, no borders/text; high-detail, cinematic fantasy creature illustration.
