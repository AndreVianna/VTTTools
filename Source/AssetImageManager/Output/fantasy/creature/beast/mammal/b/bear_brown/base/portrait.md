Ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a brown bear (Ursus arctos) in a dense forest wilderness. The beast is immense, standing 8-9 feet tall on hind legs, with thick dark brown shaggy fur, massive shoulders, and a broad head. Small dark eyes, rounded ears, and enormous paws tipped with long curved claws extended forward. The bear is in a fierce, protective stance, muscles tensed, moving with speed and power despite its bulk. Scene set in lush forest: pines, moss, fallen logs, ferns, dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy, rich earthy tones. Full view, entire bear visible, centered, no cropping. Cinematic lighting, hyper-detailed fur, claws, and environment. High-resolution, suitable for a book illustration or display panel. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or other subjects.
