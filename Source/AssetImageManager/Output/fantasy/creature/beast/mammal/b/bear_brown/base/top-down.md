Top-down bird's-eye view illustration of a colossal brown bear standing on hind legs, 8-9 feet tall when reared, with thick dark brown shaggy fur, powerful shoulders, and a broad head; small eyes, rounded ears, and enormous paws with long curved claws; in a fierce protective stance with razor-sharp claws extended, muscles visible, conveying speed and power; head oriented toward the bottom edge of the frame (looking forward along the map axis), so the gaze is forward but not toward the viewer; background transparent for seamless integration on a tabletop map; no borders, text, watermark, or environment details; single subject, full body, no cropping; high-detail fur texture, realistic lighting.
