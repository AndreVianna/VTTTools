Close-up, high-detail illustration of a muscular wild boar (mammal) about 3 feet tall at the shoulder. Coarse bristly fur in black to brown tones, with bristling spikes along the spine. Prominent curved tusks protrude from the lower jaw, sharp and upward-curving. The boar is in an aggressive charging stance, snorting and pawing the ground, small eyes gleaming with aggression. Emphasize powerful shoulders, short legs, taut muscular neck. Render on a solid neutral background with no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other subjects. Close-crop focusing on head, tusks, shoulders and forelegs; ultra-detailed, high-resolution.
