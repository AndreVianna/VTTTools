Ultra-detailed close-up fantasy illustration of a colossal brown bear (Ursus arctos) standing on hind legs, 8-9 feet tall, with thick shaggy dark brown fur, massive shoulders, broad head, small dark eyes, rounded ears, and enormous paws with long curved razor-sharp claws extended toward the viewer. Fierce protective posture, conveying surprising speed and power despite bulk. Close-up focusing on the head, shoulders, and forelimbs, with a solid neutral background. No borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or cropping; fully contained in frame. High-resolution, hyper-realistic fur texture, crisp claw details, dramatic yet natural lighting, cinematic presence, clean composition.
