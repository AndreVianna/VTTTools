High-detail full-body portrait of a muscular wild boar (beast mammal) standing 3 feet tall at the shoulder, with coarse black-to-brown bristly fur. Show powerful shoulders, short stocky legs, and curved tusks protruding upward from the lower jaw. The boar’s small eyes gleam with aggression as it snorts and grunts, in an aggressive charging stance with one forehoof pawing the ground. Set in a dense forest wilderness with dappled sunlight, mossy roots, and undergrowth. Render as a vivid, full-view fantasy creature illustration suitable for a book or display panel, with hyper-detailed fur, tusk textures, and lifelike anatomy. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or crops; single subject, no other creatures; crisp, high-resolution.
