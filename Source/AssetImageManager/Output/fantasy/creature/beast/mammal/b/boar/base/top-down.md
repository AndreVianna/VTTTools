Bird's-eye top-down view of a single muscular boar beast standing 3 feet tall at the shoulder, with coarse black-brown bristly fur and bristling spikes along the spine. It has powerful shoulders, short stocky legs, and curved tusks protruding from the lower jaw that curve upward. Its small eyes gleam with aggression. It is in an aggressive charging stance, snorting and pawing the ground, with its head oriented forward and looking ahead along the forward axis. The full body is visible from above.
