Bird's-eye top-down view of a single wolf, a medium mammal with thick gray- to brown-toned fur. From above, the head points toward the top edge of the frame (forward gaze); ears alert and forward; intelligent eyes; fangs bared in a snarling expression; piercing predatory gaze. The wolf stands on four legs, shoulder height about 3 feet, muscular and lean with predatory grace. Pack-hunting posture: low, ready to surge, legs tense, tail down. Fur texture with subtle color variation; high-detail rendering; clean silhouette. Full-body in frame, no cropping, no background elements; transparent background for seamless tabletop map integration. Lighting subtle and directional to emphasize form. No border, frame, text, watermark, signature; single subject; not facing the viewer.
