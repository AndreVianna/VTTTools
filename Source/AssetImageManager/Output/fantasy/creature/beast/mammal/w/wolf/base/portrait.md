Ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a lone wolf (mammal) in a forest wilderness. A medium-sized beast with thick gray-brown fur, intelligent amber eyes, and powerful jaws. The wolf stands on four legs, about 3 feet at the shoulder, moving with predatory grace. Ears alert and perked forward; fangs bared in a snarl; piercing predatory gaze; pack-hunting posture conveyed by taut muscles and forward-leaning stance. Setting: lush forest with dappled sunlight through tall pines, mossy ground, ferns, and distant mist. Lighting: cinematic, highly realistic fur texture, eyes, and teeth. Composition: edge-to-edge, full-body visible, centered, suitable for a book illustration or display panel. No borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or other subjects; no cropping or partial body; anatomically correct.
