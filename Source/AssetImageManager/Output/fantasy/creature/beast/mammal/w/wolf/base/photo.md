Close-up portrait of a medium-sized wolf with thick gray-brown fur, intelligent piercing eyes, and a powerful jaw. Ears alert and forward; fangs bared in a snarl. The wolf stands on four legs with a shoulder height of about 3 feet, in a pack-hunting posture that conveys predatory grace. The image shows the full head and upper chest, set against a solid neutral gray background with no other elements. High-detail, realistic illustration focusing on fur texture, eye and teeth detail, and taut neck and shoulder musculature.
