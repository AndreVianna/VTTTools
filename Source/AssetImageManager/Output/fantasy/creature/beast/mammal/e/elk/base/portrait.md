Create a vivid, high-detail full-body portrait of a majestic male elk (wapiti) standing about 5 feet tall at the shoulder with a powerful, muscular build. Coat tan-brown with a darker neck and legs. Massive branching antlers spanning 4 to 5 feet across, with many tines. Large brown eyes, tall alert ears. The elk stands in a natural scene blending forest, grassland, and distant mountains, with dappled sunlight and a gentle breeze ruffling the grasses. The pose is proud and noble, exuding grace and strength. Full body visible, no cropping. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or other subjects. Rich fur texture, detailed antlers, realistic shading and depth for cinematic, painterly realism.
