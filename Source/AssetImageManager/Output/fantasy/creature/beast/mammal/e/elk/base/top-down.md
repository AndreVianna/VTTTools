Bird's-eye top-down illustration of a single elk (mammal) with a magnificent muscular build, standing about 5 feet tall at the shoulder. Coat tan/brown with darker neck and legs. The male's antlers are massive and branching, spanning 4-5 feet wide. Features include large brown eyes and tall alert ears. The elk's head is oriented forward along the body axis, with the gaze forward but not toward the camera, creating a noble forward-facing posture from above. High-detail, realistic fantasy style suitable for seamless tabletop map integration. Plain neutral background with no scenery, borders, text, watermarks, signatures, or cropping. No multiple subjects or duplicates; no partial body or edges cut off.
