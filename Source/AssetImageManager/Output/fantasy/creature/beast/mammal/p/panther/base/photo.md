Close-up, ultra-detailed fantasy illustration of a sleek black panther (Mammal) with a muscular build, about two feet at the shoulder and six feet long from nose to tail, portrayed in a crouched hunting posture. The jet-black coat is glossy with a subtle blue-black sheen. Powerful jaws, retractable claws, and piercing yellow-green eyes that glow in the shadows. The body is lit to reveal coiled muscles and poised readiness to pounce. Background is a solid neutral color (plain charcoal gray) with no texture, no scenery, no other subjects. The head is fully visible in frame; no borders, no text, no watermarks, no cropping, no blur. Style: crisp, high-detail fantasy creature illustration suitable as a token for a virtual tabletop map.
