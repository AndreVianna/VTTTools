Bird's-eye top-down view of a single Panther (Mammal), a sleek, muscular big cat with a glossy black coat, about 2 feet at the shoulder and 6 feet long from nose to tail tip, fully in frame. The panther is in a crouched hunting posture with muscles coiled, tail tucked along the body, ready to pounce; retractable claws sheathed, subtle paw definition. Eyes are piercing yellow-green and glow faintly in the shadows, with the gaze directed along the forward axis of the creature. No background elements; transparent background for seamless map integration; high-resolution, ultra-detailed, crisp edges; no borders, frames, text, watermark, signature, or additional subjects.
