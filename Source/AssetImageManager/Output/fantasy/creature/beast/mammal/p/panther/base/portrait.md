Ultra-detailed full-body portrait of a sleek black panther (a mammal), muscular and formidable, standing about 2 feet at the shoulder and roughly 6 feet long from nose to tail. Glossy midnight fur, powerful jaws, retractable claws, and piercing yellow-green eyes that glow in the shadows. The panther is in a crouched hunting posture, muscles coiled, ready to pounce. Scenes set in a dense jungle and forest with rocky outcrops and the dark entrance of a mountain cave nearby; moonlight filters through the canopy, casting emerald highlights on the coat and enhancing a nocturnal, cinematic mood. Full view from nose to tail tip, no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or cropping; high-detail, vivid color, lifelike anatomy.
