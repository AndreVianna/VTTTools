Close-up, ultra-detailed digital painting of a Giant Rat Beast (Rodent) the size of a small dog, shown against a solid neutral plain gray background. Features: matted gray-brown mangy fur with patches of disease, a long hairless tail curling behind, a hunched scavenging posture. Face with beady red eyes, twitching whiskers, and prominent yellow overgrown incisors protruding from a snarling mouth. The fur and skin show signs of rot/disease, with subtle grime; overall impression of filth without gore. Single subject, no borders or text, no other elements.
