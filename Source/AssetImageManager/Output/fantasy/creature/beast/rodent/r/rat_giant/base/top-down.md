Top-down bird's-eye view of a single giant rat beast, the size of a small dog, fully visible and uncropped, marching toward the bottom edge of the frame as if looking toward the viewer. Mangy gray-brown fur with patchy diseased areas, a long hairless tail curling behind, and a snarling muzzle with prominent yellow overgrown incisors. Beady red eyes, twitching whiskers, and a hunched scavenging posture. Hyper-detailed texture on fur, skin, and dentition; no gore—implied rot and filth through dirty fur and dull, sickly coloration. No other subjects, no background scenery; transparent background for seamless tabletop map tile integration.
