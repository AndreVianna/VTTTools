Full-body, high-detail fantasy portrait of a Giant Rat Beast (Rodent) the size of a small dog, standing in a rugged mountains and hills landscape. The creature has mangy gray-brown fur, a long hairless tail, beady red eyes, twitching whiskers, and prominent yellow incisors. Its posture is hunched and scavenging, with a diseased, matted coat that suggests rot and filth. Dramatic, cinematic lighting highlights rough fur texture and the yellow teeth. One subject only, full view, no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or cropping.
