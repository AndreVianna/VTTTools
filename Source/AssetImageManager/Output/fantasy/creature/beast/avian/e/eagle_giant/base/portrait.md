Create a hyper-detailed, full-view fantasy portrait of a Giant Avian Beast: an enormous eagle with a 20-foot wingspan, wings fully spread, golden-brown plumage with subtle iridescence, and a wickedly curved beak. The creature has piercing golden eyes, a muscular chest, and razor-sharp talons extended in a ready-to-swoop pose. It exudes regal bearing with the head held high. Scene set among rugged mountains and rolling hills, distant jagged peaks, wind-swept atmosphere, sunlight catching the plumage in warm golds and bronze tones with cool shadows. The cry echoes across the mountains, implied by the dramatic pose and movement of air and feathers. Emphasize ultra-detailed feather texture, realistic anatomy, dynamic lighting, and a majestic, formidable mood. Ensure the full body and expansive wingspan are visible, centered, with no borders, frames, text, watermark, or other subjects; no cropping or distortion; suitable for a book illustration or display panel.
