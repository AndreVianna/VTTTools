Top-down bird's-eye view of a colossal avian beast: Giant Eagle, wingspan 20 feet, wings fully spread, colossal golden-brown plumage with fine feather detail, wickedly curved beak, piercing golden eyes, talons extended forward as if snatching prey, regal bearing, body oriented in the forward direction with gaze aligned along the forward axis (not toward the viewer); full body and wings in frame; transparent background for seamless tabletop map tile integration; ultra-detailed high-resolution illustration with crisp linework and shading; lighting from above to emphasize form; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures; no background scenery, terrain, environment details, or additional subjects.
