Full-body portrait of a 12-foot-tall humanoid fire elemental, a living column of flame in reds, oranges, and yellows that constantly roars and shifts. Its eyes burn white-hot, flames crackle, heat waves distort the air around it, and it leaves scorched footprints as it moves. Set in a volcanic region on the elemental fire plane among burning ruins, lava flows, and ash-filled skies. Dramatic lighting, ultra-detailed textures, vivid flame glow with embers, dynamic sense of motion and heat haze. Ensure correct anatomy, single subject, no borders, text, watermark, or cropping.
