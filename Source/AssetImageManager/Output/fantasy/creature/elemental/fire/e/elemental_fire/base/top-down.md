Bird's-eye top-down view of a single 12-foot-tall humanoid fire elemental, a living column of flame in red, orange, and yellow constantly roiling and roaring; head region as a crown of brighter flames with white-hot eyes visible as luminous hotspots within the blaze; heat waves distort the air around the figure; oriented with its forward direction toward the top edge of the frame so from above the form reads as a forward-moving column rather than a face-on portrait; leaves scorched footprints on the ground as it moves and radiates waves of flame outward; transparent background for seamless integration into a virtual tabletop map; no borders, frames, text, or extra scenery; high-resolution, crisp details, and glow effects emphasizing heat and fire.
