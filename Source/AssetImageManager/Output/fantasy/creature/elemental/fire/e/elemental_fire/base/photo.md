Ultra-detailed close-up illustration of a twelve-foot-tall humanoid fire elemental, a living column of flame composed of red, orange, and yellow tongues of fire. The form is dynamic and roiling, with a head-like cluster and broad shoulders. Eyes burn white-hot, brilliant white cores. Flames roar and crackle, heat waves shimmer and distort the air around the silhouette. The ground at its feet bears scorched footprints as it moves. The background is a solid neutral gray, with no borders, frames, text, watermarks, or other scenery. Lighting emphasizes the inner glow of the flames and a subtle halo of heat around the figure.
