Bird’s-eye top-down view of a Water Elemental, a living mass of water forming a roughly 12-foot-tall humanoid silhouette, seen from directly above and oriented with its forward direction toward the bottom edge of the frame (not facing the viewer). The body is made of clear to blue-green water that constantly flows, ripples, and splashes, with eyes that swirl like whirlpools. The surface shows continuous rippling, spray, and a wet trail as it moves, and the form can dissolve into puddles or rear up as a towering wave. No borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or any other elements; no background scenery or environment details; a single, full-body figure on a transparent/plain background suitable for seamless integration into a virtual tabletop map.
