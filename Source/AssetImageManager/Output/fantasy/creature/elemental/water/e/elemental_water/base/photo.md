Close-up illustration of a Water Elemental, a living mass of water forming a roughly 12-foot-tall humanoid. The body is clear to blue-green water that constantly flows, ripples, and splashes. Eyes swirl like whirlpools. The form crashes and splashes with every movement, leaving a wet trail. The figure can dissolve into puddles or rear up as towering waves. View shows the head and upper torso fully in frame (not cropped), with translucent, flowing contours, vivid highlights, and reflections in blues and teals. Solid neutral background (soft gray) suitable for a tabletop map token. High detail, crisp linework; no borders, frames, text, watermarks, signatures, or environment details; no other subjects; no blur or cropping.
