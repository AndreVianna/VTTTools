Vertical, full-view portrait illustration of a Water Elemental, a living mass of water roughly 12 feet tall in a humanoid shape. The body is clear to blue-green water that continually flows, ripples, and splashes; light glints off translucent surfaces; eyes swirl like whirlpools. The form crashes and splashes with every movement, leaving a wet trail of droplets and mist. The creature can dissolve into a puddle or rise into a towering wave, with foam and spray accenting the transitions. Set on a rocky coastal shoreline with sea spray, surf, tide pools, and distant gulls. Palette of cool blues, teals, and whites, with luminous highlights and reflections from dawn or dusk light. Show the complete figure from head to toe in a dramatic, cinematic fantasy style, highly detailed with realistic water textures, foam, and motion. No borders, frames, text, or other subjects.
