## General Guidance

This project is .NET 9 C# Aspire Solution called VTTTools.
It creates a Virtual Table Top (VTT) RPG Game interface for online play. It provides tools to help Dungeon Masters (DMs) and players set up and play tabletop role-playing games online, including maps, tokens, dice rolling, and chat functionality.

First, read the key files listed below.
Second, read in detail the source code under the 'Source' folder and all it's sub-folders to acknowledge the current state of the project implementation.
Finally, do a deep analysis to understand the project, compare it with the design documentation and prepare to continue the its development.
Ask me any questions to accomplish that.
